1
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,410
你到底是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,630
-西沃恩  -你他妈离我远点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Siobhan. - Stay the fuck away from me.

3
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,240
你耍了我们  我  布罗克  艾米特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You played us. Me, Brock, Emmett.

4
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,340
你的一切都是假的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything about you is a lie.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,580
西沃恩  听我说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Siobhan, listen to me.

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,690
不要动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't.

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,840
好  好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay. Okay.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,360
好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,000
把枪放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put the gun down.

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,360
是我  西沃恩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's me, Siobhan.

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
听到了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You hear me?

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,100
是我啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's me.

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,060
别这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on.

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,020
只是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's just me.

15
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,380
你根本不存在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There is no you.

16
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,120
你根本不存在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There is no you.

17
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,230
你根本不存在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There is no you.

18
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,390
让我一个人静静  你出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need time to think. Just get out.

19
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,240
我们该谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We should talk about this.

20
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,730
给我滚出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get the fuck out!

21
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,690
快滚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now!

22
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,770
-晚上好  -马里奥和弗兰克呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hey, good evening. - Where's Mario and Frank?

23
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,170
他们在雷默广场那边加班呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, um, they had to do a double at Raymor Plaza.

24
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,170
好像是水管泄漏了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Some kind of plumbing leak.

25
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,510
他们正搞得浑身是屎呢  真的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're up to their eyeballs in shit, literally.

26
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,070
-是啊  -把你们的证件给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah. - Give me your badges.

27
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,510
我们都已经扫描过了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We already scanned them.

28
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,170
我要再扫描一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I'm gonna scan them again.

29
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,560
请原谅我的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Excuse my friend.

30
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,870
事故之后他反应就有点迟钝了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's a little slow since the accident.

31
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,090
怎么  出问题了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? Something wrong?

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,910
你为什么把头发剪了  伙计
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why'd you cut your hair, man?

33
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,700
什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

34
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,270
原来是爆炸头
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The 'fro.

35
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,690
我总跟秃子在一块儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, just hanging around guys like this,

36
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,850
留个爆炸头好像在炫耀似的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}it just felt too much like showing off.

37
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,350
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks.

38
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,700
晚上愉快
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Have a good night.

39
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,500
谢谢  你也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, thank you. You, too.

40
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,040
好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

41
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,890
大哥们在安保室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Big Brother's in the house.

42
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,440
你看到我看到的画面了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You seeing what I'm seeing?

43
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,480
操  他们目不转睛地盯着显示器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shit, they're watching them monitors like hawks.

44
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,520
那咱们就换换画面
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then let's change the view.

45
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,770
好啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right.

46
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,040
你那边安全了  去弄那个公式吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, you're clear. Go get that formula.

47
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,010
-那是个算法  -咱说的是一回事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It's an algorithm. - Yeah, you say tomato.

48
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,460
有个警卫正往那边走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, one of the guards is on the move.

49
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,000
-你最好抓紧时间  -你别瞎叨叨了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You better step on it. - You need to step off it.

50
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,340
我又不是在这里看视频  可以快进
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I ain't watching fucking YouTube videos up in here.

51
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,900
他上电梯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn, he's getting on the elevator.

52
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,950
-你搭档呢  -去方便了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Where's your partner? - Oh, he went to take a leak.

53
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,900
你懂的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know?

54
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,000
你得加把劲了  伙计
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, you better step on it, man.

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,810
马上就有人过去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gonna get real crowded in there real soon.

56
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,840
欧了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Got you.

57
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,330
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job.

58
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,280
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job.

59
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,440
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job.

60
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,680
-抱歉我迟到了  -45分钟了  卡莉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Sorry I'm late. - 45 minutes, Carrie.

61
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,880
她的老师等不了这么久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Her teacher couldn't wait.

62
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,470
她怎么说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What did she say?

63
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,440
说蒂法不交作业  上课捣乱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, Deva's missing assignments, she's disruptive in class,

64
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,280
态度也很差
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and basically her attitude sucks.

65
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,030
学校明显觉得我们的女儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And apparently the school feels that our daughter

66
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,260
在家里没人管教
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is lacking any kind of discipline or structure at home.

67
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,030
-这是我的错吗  -我没指责你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- And that's my fault? - I'm not pointing fingers.

68
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,020
你就是在指责我  你自己可是个嫖妓的市长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, you just did and this from a mayor who bangs hookers.

69
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,450
那抛弃家庭  跑去追杀自己的黑道父亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, and like abandoning your family to go off to hunt down

70
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,570
就是我们宣扬的家庭价值观了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your gangster father is a lesson in family values?

71
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,000
你去死吧  戈登
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck you, Gordon.

72
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,120
卡莉  求你别这样了好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Carrie, can you stop, please?

73
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,780
我们需要做得更好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, we need to do better.

74
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,850
我知道我在为自己处理不好所发生的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I realize that I have been blaming everybody else

75
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,410
而责怪身边的所有人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for my inability to handle everything that's happened.

76
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,220
我只是...这是我们的家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just-- it's our family.

77
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,980
你知道我此前从未当过受害者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you know that I have never been a victim in my life

78
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,780
我已经受够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I'm done with that.

79
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,930
我想为了我们所有人  解决这件事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want to figure this out for all of us.

80
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,890
在我家乡有这么个习俗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where I come from, it's customary

81
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,760
圆满完成工作后得喝一杯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to drink to a job well done.

82
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,290
完成
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Done?

83
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,830
那个算法只是这个混账群集的小提示
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That algorithm was just the tip of this cluster fuck.

84
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,270
不  这是个小胜利  可以激励我们继续前进
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, it's the small victories that keep you in the fight.

85
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,500
我知道你号称是梅伯里地区的活佛什么的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know you the Dalai Lama of Mayberry and all that shit,

86
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,850
但这不代表你说的话都是真理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but that don't mean everything coming out your mouth is wisdom.

87
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,150
现在离庆祝还远着呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It is far from party time.

88
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,280
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine.

89
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,640
干杯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cheers.

90
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,480
你这次又惹着谁了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who'd you piss off this time?

91
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,140
我们可能得跑了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We may have to bail.

92
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,910
你是说不要这活了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, on the job?

93
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,820
什么都不要了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}On everything.

94
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,550
真的什么都不要了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything everything?

95
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,270
有多严重
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How bad is it?

96
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,190
-西沃恩手里有我的案底  -我靠
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Siobhan has the police file on me. - Oh, fuck.

97
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,150
那我们现在怎么还不赶快离开这鬼地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So why aren't we already doing 95 out of this shithole?

98
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,960
可能因为她不会告发我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Could be she won't turn me in.

99
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,040
我给你说说明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me explain something to you.

100
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,940
假条子  也就是你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There are fake cops-- that's you--

101
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,580
真条子  也就是她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and there are real cops-- that's her.

102
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,210
区别就是真条子会把你丫交出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Difference being real cops will turn your ass in.

103
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,260
也可能不会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe not.

104
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,180
你能不能告诉这个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Would you please tell this man

105
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,320
想收手不干早他妈晚了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}it is way past time to cut and fuckin' run?

106
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,260
你们俩做好要做的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You two both do what you gotta do.

107
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,430
但我该去工作了  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I'm going to work, Job.

108
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,330
宝贝  我希望你用力的回想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Baby, I want you to try real hard

109
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,270
上一次你在女人身上孤注一掷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to remember what happened

110
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,490
后果怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the last time you rolled the dice on a woman.

111
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,670
去他妈的  我走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck this. I'm packing.

112
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,680
-你准备什么时候告诉我  -布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- When were you gonna tell me? - Brock.

113
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,710
你现在都开始为普罗科特工作了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're working for Proctor now,

114
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,570
艾米丽  你疯了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Emily? Have you lost it?

115
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,010
你怎么会知道的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How could you possibly know that?

116
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,040
-我给你的中介打电话了  -你干嘛了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I called your agency. - You did what?

117
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,620
-我没有你的消息  -老天啊  布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I didn't hear from you. - Jesus Christ, Brock.

118
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,980
-我是在担心你  -你是在监视我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I was worried about you. - You're spying on me.

119
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,850
-我不是监视你  -你太不可以理喻了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm not spying on you. - You're unbelievable.

120
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,680
你知道普罗科特有多危险吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you have any idea how dangerous Proctor is?

121
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,080
知道他和哪些人来往吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The kind of people that he deals with?

122
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,690
结果你现在还跑到他家去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And now you're living in the goddamn house?

123
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,770
他母亲要死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}His mother is dying.

124
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,570
没错  但要死的也不是她一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, well, apparently she's not the only one.

125
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,960
之前我在他家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was there the other day

126
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,020
从泳池里捞出一具帮派分子的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}fishing a dead gangbanger out of his pool.

127
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,080
小艾  那里很危险
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Em, bad things happen there.

128
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,540
我关心病人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I care for the dying.

129
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,020
那是我的工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's what I do.

130
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,970
我以后也会如此
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's what I'm gonna keep on doing.

131
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,120
听着  小艾  我求你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen. Em, I'm begging you.

132
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,480
离那个人越远越好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get as far away from that man as possible.

133
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,490
我唯一该远离的人  是你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The only one I need to get away from is you.

134
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,170
艾米丽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Emily.

135
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,850
很有意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's very interesting.

136
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,680
事态有变就给我打电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just call me if anything changes.

137
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,580
汤米·里特斯通的遗体已经准许释放
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tommy Littlestone's body has been cleared for release.

138
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,950
我肯定他的兄弟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm pretty sure his brother's

139
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,630
迫切地希望马上把他带回居留地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}eager to get him back to the reservation.

140
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,500
我也想去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want to go, too.

141
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,590
可以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right.

142
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,190
谢谢  叔叔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you, Uncle.

143
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,110
我妈快把我逼疯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My mother is driving me crazy.

144
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,830
我做什么她都不顺眼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She's got a problem with everything I do.

145
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,940
什么时候想跟我换妈  说一声就行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Any time you want to trade moms, just say the word.

146
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,160
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry.

147
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,300
我不觉得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, didn't think so.

148
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,000
麦克斯怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How is Max doing?

149
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,840
大概还不错吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine, I guess.

150
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,800
麦克斯想要这个游戏好几个月了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Max has been wanting that game for months.

151
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,120
-75美元买个游戏  什么鬼  -太疯狂了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- $75 for a video game? What the hell?  - It's crazy.

152
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,920
她怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How's she doing?

153
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
舒适地休息中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Resting comfortably.

154
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,700
新药止痛效果更好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The new meds are doing a better job with the pain.

155
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,820
很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's good.

156
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,680
谢谢你把她照顾得这么好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you for taking such good care of her.

157
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,360
她应得的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it's what she deserves.

158
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,890
我们都应得的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's what we all deserve.

159
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,180
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

160
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,940
你怎么样  普罗科特先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How are you holding up, Mr. Proctor?

161
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,430
我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Me?

162
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,300
快死的可不是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I'm not the one who's dying.

163
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,300
可你很痛苦  而这种疼痛无药可医
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you are suffering and you don't get any meds.

164
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,760
做为强者的坏处就是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The downside to being strong for everyone else

165
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,270
你永远没有自己的时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is that you never get a moment for yourself.

166
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,640
如果你想聊聊天或者...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you ever want to talk or...

167
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,310
反正我也没其它地方可去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've got nowhere else to be.

168
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,300
过来坐坐吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you want to sit down?

169
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,450
三号桌的苹果派
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Apple on three.

170
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,140
六号桌已经可以点餐了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Table six is ready to order.

171
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,830
九号桌需要金属餐具
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Table nine needs silverware.

172
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,040
十二桌的露营家需要第三次咖啡续杯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the campers on 12 are asking for a third refill on coffee.

173
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,090
过来帮一下忙啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A little help here.

174
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,220
十二桌还在等续杯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}12 is still asking for that refill.

175
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,450
卡莉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Carrie.

176
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,880
-现在怎么办  -等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What now? - We wait.

177
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,370
待在车里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay here.

178
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,950
上车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get in.

179
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,480
我一直跟着我叔叔练习
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've been practicing with my uncle.

180
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,860
你没什么驾驶经验
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not an experienced driver.

181
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,220
那就让我积累经验吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then let's go get me some experience.

182
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,260
搞什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell?

183
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,970
你找我  出什么事了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You called. What's going on?

184
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,450
我要撤回普罗科特的认罪协议
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm withdrawing Proctor's plea bargain.

185
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,380
我不明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't understand.

186
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,500
我们早上第一件事就是提出动议
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll file the motion first thing in the morning.

187
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,870
斯柏林一定会发火的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sperling is gonna go apeshit on us.

188
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,750
把这当做额外奖励吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that's just the gravy.

189
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,230
顺便说句抱歉  我之前是个蠢货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}By the way, I'm sorry I was a jerk.

190
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,630
你不是蠢货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You weren't a jerk.

191
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,100
你是个混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You were an asshole.

192
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,630
我该走了  你也好收拾下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should probably go. Let you get settled.

193
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,720
看来你有秘密啊  头儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've got secrets, boss.

194
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,830
谁没有呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't we all?

195
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,630
如果事情太多  或者你想找人谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If they ever get to be too much or if you want to talk...

196
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,690
-明天见  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah.

197
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,160
我是西沃恩·凯利
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi, you've reached Siobhan Kelly.

198
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,460
请留言
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please leave a message.

199
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,440
-胡德  -怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hood. - Yeah?

200
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,010
我刚接到消防救援部的电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just got a call from Fire and Rescue.

201
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,650
六号公路上有事故
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a wreck out on Highway 6.

202
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,340
你来处理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You handle it.

203
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,930
两人到医院时已死亡  都是红骨帮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Two DOAs, both Redbones.

204
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,070
他们在转移汤米·里特斯通的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They were transporting Tommy Littlestone's body.

205
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,130
很好  走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Great, let's go.

206
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,620
龙舌兰酒  哪种的都行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tequila. Whatever you got.

207
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,220
她要加冰的陈年龙舌兰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She'll have the Anejo, chilled.

208
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,430
好酒配佳人嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A real woman like you, I think that she deserves the best.

209
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,590
你请客吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You buying?

210
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,670
是的  女士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, ma'am.

211
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,420
来两杯吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Make it a double.

212
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,770
一直上  别停
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And keep 'em coming.

213
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,430
我还以为我今天最倒霉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought I was having a bad day.

214
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
什么情况
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do we got?

215
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,100
驾驶员是哈坎·埃文斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Driver is Hakan Evans.

216
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,070
是他在停尸房签字领的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He signed for the body at the morgue.

217
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,060
我们需要牙医记录来确认另一名死者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll need dental records to identify the other.

218
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,060
-有目击证人吗  -这地方可不会有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Any witnesses? - Not out here.

219
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,100
第二组刹车痕迹表明当时还有其他车辆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A second set of skid marks confirms another vehicle was involved.

220
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,470
-很可能是场意外  -有可能
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Could have been an accident. - Yeah.

221
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,170
你知道这不是场意外
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know this wasn't an accident.

222
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,430
不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No?

223
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,160
切顿会把这当成是对他的宣战
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton is gonna see this as a declaration of war.

224
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,070
就算是  也是普罗科特的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, well, that's Proctor's problem.

225
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,600
我们怎么处理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, what are we gonna do about it?

226
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
-什么也不做  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Nothing. - What?

227
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,230
我们他妈的置身事外
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We stay the fuck out of it.

228
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,510
这酒真爽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ah, it burns so good.

229
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,800
你笑起来真的很美
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have a real pretty smile.

230
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,080
-我还是很有魅力  -没错  女士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah, I still got it. - Yes, ma'am.

231
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,290
那最好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's good.

232
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,230
你的摩托车停在外边了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that your bike parked outside?

233
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,780
性感的野兽  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sexy beast, isn't she?

234
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:37,930
我以前也梦想过拥有那样一辆车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I used to dream about owning a machine like that.

235
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,830
为什么说是以前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you mean used to?

236
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,650
物是人非了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Another life.

237
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,340
那可是个悲惨的故事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that is a terribly sad story.

238
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:50,590
不过不用担心  因为你的新朋友斯凯沃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But don't you worry 'cause your new buddy Scuyver,

239
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,730
他总是能带来愉快的结局
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}well, he's all about the happy endings.

240
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,060
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that right?

241
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,350
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That is right.

242
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,950
我觉得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think that...

243
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,550
也许我们该去更隐蔽一点的地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}maybe you and me should go somewhere more private.

244
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,750
听上去不错  不过还是算了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That sounds great, but, no.

245
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,820
我要走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I gotta go.

246
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,440
-下次吧  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Maybe next time. - What?

247
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,050
为了这场欢聚我可是买了六杯酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got six drinks invested in this little party.

248
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,390
所以你哪也不能去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you ain't going nowhere

249
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,790
除非你表示点感激之情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}till you show me a little gratitude.

250
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,670
我说不  就是不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When I say no, I mean it.

251
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,230
我是西沃恩·凯利
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi, you've reached Siobhan Kelly.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where are you?

254
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,800
你应该问我不在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should be asking where I'm not.

255
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,030
因为20分钟之内
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because in 20 minutes,

256
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,080
我就会离开见鬼的宾州女妖镇了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the answer's gonna be Banshee, Pennsyl-fucking-vania.

257
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,370
等我到今天结束  我和你一起走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me until the end of the day and I'll come with you.

258
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,610
还有些琐碎的事要处理下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just gotta tie up a few loose ends.

259
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,740
那你处理得快点  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then you tie them up quick, baby,

260
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,550
我们好离开这鬼地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and let's get the fuck out of here.

261
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,320
-蒂法  -干吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hey, Deva. - What?

262
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,510
-你没去学校  -我只是晚了点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You aren't in school. - I'm just running a little late.

263
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,210
也许是因为你走错方向了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, maybe that's 'cause you're going the wrong way.

264
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,850
-好像你没翘过课一样  -我没被抓过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Like you never ditched. - I never got caught.

265
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,660
蒂法  那天的事对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Deva, I'm sorry about the other day.

266
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,560
已经过去了  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm over it, seriously.

267
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,040
我不是有意气走你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, I didn't mean to blow you off.

268
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,670
好吗  你来得太突然了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay? I-- you caught me off guard

269
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,310
我说错话了  真的对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and everything came out wrong and I'm sorry.

270
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,770
不会再有下次了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it won't happen again, okay?

271
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:51,250
从今开始  你只是搞大我妈肚子的混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}From now on, you're just the asshole who knocked up my mom.

272
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,770
好吧  我是混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, fine, I'm the asshole.

273
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,190
自从我来  除了麻烦什么也没给你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, I've caused you nothing but problems since I got here,

274
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,610
所以我理解
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I get it.

275
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,440
差不多吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Pretty much.

276
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,140
我操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck.

277
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,780
-你有什么好在乎的  -我就是在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Why do you even care? - I just do.

278
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,990
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why?

279
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,960
我老爹从来没在乎过我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, my old man never gave a shit about me.

280
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,510
明白吗  我是说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right? I mean...

281
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,840
你可以说他诚实
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I guess you could call him honest.

282
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,210
但我最恨他这一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I fucking hated him for it.

283
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,850
现在还恨  我希望自己不恨了  但我恨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I still do. I wish I didn't, but I do.

284
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,060
我不希望你恨我  蒂法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't want you to hate me, Deva.

285
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,570
但我不能强迫你做任何事  谁都不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I can't make you do anything, no one can.

286
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,770
这种事要你自己做主
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's a choice you gotta make on your own.

287
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,260
你是不是要离开了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're leaving, aren't you?

288
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,200
我必须离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have to.

289
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,000
如果我想让你留下  你会在乎吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Does it matter that I want you to stay?

290
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,830
会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes.

291
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,900
我很在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It matters.

292
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,450
懂吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay?

293
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,730
但是我捅了大篓子  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I made a huge fucking mess, kid.

294
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,640
我必须离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I have to go.

295
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,030
我不恨你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't hate you.

296
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,750
好吧  有一点点恨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, maybe a little bit.

297
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,410
我可以接受
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can live with that.

298
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,500
你他妈在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck are you doing?

299
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,340
杰克逊  你好  你有预约吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi, Jackson. We have an appointment?

300
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
我们明明说好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We had a goddamn deal.

301
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,360
好吧  我们立场变了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, well, our position has changed.

302
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,880
你不能这样做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can't do this.

303
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,000
已经做了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's already done.

304
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,990
普罗科特将会上法庭
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Proctor will have his day in court.

305
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,780
戈登  你在犯大错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're making a big mistake, Gordon.

306
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,210
杰克逊  小心说话  听起来几乎是威胁了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Careful, Jackson, that almost sounded like a threat.

307
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,660
这是警告
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's a warning.

308
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,880
我会不惜一切代价找你麻烦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna come at you with everything I've got.

309
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,800
你要付出的代价是  输掉官司
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, and what you've got is a guilty client.

310
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,490
你应该劝劝你老板
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should talk some sense into your boss.

311
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,090
这件事也会牵扯到你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your ass is on the line here, too.

312
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,770
谢谢你的关心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I appreciate your concern.

313
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,230

314
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,400
该死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shit.

315
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,360
你想谈谈吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you want to talk about it?

316
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,350
我太傻了  我只是有点得意忘形了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was stupid. I just got carried away is all.

317
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,430
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}极限竞速5

318
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,760
我觉得被困住了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I feel trapped.

319
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,490
我不停地从梦中惊醒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I keep waking up from a dream

320
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,230
却意识到现实生活才是真正的噩梦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to realize that it's real life that's become the nightmare.

321
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,770
我就会做一些很危险很愚蠢的行为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then I do these stupid, dangerous things.

322
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,920
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know that.

323
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,750
只是...我都快喘不过气来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's just... I need to breathe.

324
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,140
我知道那种感觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I know how that feels.

325
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,560
还好有你陪着我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's good to have you around.

326
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,480
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

327
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,710
-说到这个  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- About that. - What?

328
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,090
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

329
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,910
我知道这样很自私  但我不希望你离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know I'm being selfish, but I don't want you to go.

330
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,910
至少别这么快
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not now.

331
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,810
但其实已经别无选择了  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, there's really no choice anymore, is there?

332
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,880
你真的觉得她会逮捕你吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you really think she'd arrest you?

333
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,500
这已经不重要了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It doesn't really matter, does it?

334
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,670
她已经知道了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She knows.

335
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,780
你准备去哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where are you gonna go?

336
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,090
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know.

337
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,510
哪都可以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anywhere.

338
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,370
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right.

339
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,670
蒂法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deva.

340
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,530
她会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She'll be okay.

341
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,190
她很坚强
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She's strong.

342
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,610
像她妈妈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Like her mom.

343
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,300
那你呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And what about you?

344
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,030
你会没事吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you gonna be okay?

345
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,750
当然了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Of course.

346
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,740
你好像不是很开心  没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You look upset. Everything okay?

347
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,450
会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It'll be all right.

348
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,890
我们得谈谈学校的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know we have to talk about school.

349
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,800
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

350
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,120
但今晚算了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not tonight, though.

351
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,250
好好休息吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get some sleep.

352
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,860
好的  晚安
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay. Good night.

353
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,750
晚安
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good night.

354
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,850
你可以把衣服脱掉了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can get undressed now.

355
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,650
你要走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you leaving?

356
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,330
你想管红骨帮的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You wanna take on the Redbones,

357
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,640
随你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}go right ahead.

358
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,940
我不像你年轻气盛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm too old and too tired

359
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,930
我不想多管闲事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to be sticking my nose where it don't belong.

360
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,040
我们可是警察啊  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're the goddamn police, Karl.

361
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,390
我要回家了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm going home.

362
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,570
除非这房子着火了  否则不要找我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't call me unless the building's on fire.

363
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,660
我还是觉得你没点警察的样子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I still don't think you're much of a cop,

364
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,920
但我觉得你是真想扳倒普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I think you're serious about getting Proctor.

365
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,030
这个镇子一直在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And this town's been waiting

366
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,520
等待你这样的人  等了很久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for somebody to do that for a long, long time.

367
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,530
警长  你知道他们为什么怕我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff, do you know why they're afraid of me?

368
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,060
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why is that?

369
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,080
因为他们应该怕我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because they should be.

370
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,450
或许你也应该怕我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And maybe you should be, too.

371
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,730
你没有证据  没有尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have no evidence, no body,

372
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,330
连一个名字你都给不出
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}not even a name you say.

373
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,760
你会把他送进监狱吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Would you put him away?

374
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,830
你到底能不能把他关起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Could you even put him away?

375
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,600
有罪裁决可能要蹲五年监狱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A guilty verdict could mean five years in prison.

376
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,910
不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not acceptable.

377
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,310
我会想尽办法延缓判决进程
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-- I will file every motion I can to slow the process down,

378
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,330
除非有奇迹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but barring a miracle,

379
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,400
不然你的案子一定会由陪审团裁决
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your case is gonna be decided by a jury.

380
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,670
那就等你给我创造奇迹了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then a miracle is exactly what you're gonna get me.

381
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,680
明白吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You get it?

382
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,380
-喂  -凯  我是艾米丽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah? - Kai, it's Emily.

383
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,000
你母亲病情恶化了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your mother's taken a turn.

384
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,160
快回家来吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should come home now.

385
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,760
她时间不多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She doesn't have much time.

386
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,260
谢谢你  艾米丽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you, Emily.

387
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,010
我马上来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm on my way.

388
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,650
你最好给我搞定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You fucking fix this.

389
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,480
打烊了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're closed.

390
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,350
走开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Leave.

391
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,650
-滚出去  -你到底想干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Get out. - What the hell are you doing?

392
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,520
你最好赶紧走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You need to leave now.

393
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,420
你管你有什么事  警长  现在不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whatever it is, Sheriff, it has to wait.

394
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,450
不要啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No!

395
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,900
天呐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus.

396
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,230
叫警察啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Call the police.

397
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,140
他就是警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, he is the police.

398
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,180
他妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God damn it.

399
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,080
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

400
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,700
来  起来吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on. Get up.

401
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,060
起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get up.

402
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,300
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You okay?

403
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,050
凯·普罗科特  你因攻击警察被逮捕了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kai Proctor, you're under arrest for assaulting an officer.

404
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,840
等等  这是自卫行为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whoa, whoa. It was self-defense.

405
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,710
-胡德先动的手  -后退
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hood attacked him first. - Back up or

406
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,280
不然连你一起抓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll cuff your ass, too.

407
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,960
去你奶奶那  她需要你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go to your grandmother. She needs you.

408
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,120
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, let's go.

409
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,310
抱歉久等了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry for the wait.

410
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,700
你们现在都可以回去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can all head back now.

411
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,260
警长现在不在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The sheriff will need just a few minutes.

412
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,690
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go.

413
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,790
有何贵干
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}May I help you?

414
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,530
我想见警长  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would like to speak to the sheriff, please.

415
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,730
你们有约吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is he expecting you?

416
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,170
-没有  女士  -请坐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- No, ma'am. - Take a seat.

417
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,750
不如这样  你去那边等吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}On second thought, go wait back there.

418
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,790
是的  女士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, ma'am.

419
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,240
这可比骚扰严重多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is beyond harassment.

420
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,100
我有很多目击者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've got a dozen witnesses

421
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,100
可以作证是你先出手打架的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who will testify that you started the fight.

422
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,250
-你他妈闭嘴好吗  -搞什么飞机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Why don't you shut the fuck up? - What the hell happened?

423
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,140
-他差点谋杀了我的客户  -我没在问你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He tried to murder my client. - I wasn't asking you.

424
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,830
你知道这对我们有多不利吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you have any idea how bad this looks?

425
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,170
爷一点儿都不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ask me if I care.

426
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,870
-胡德  -别过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hood. - Stay!

427
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,690
你好啊  农场小子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's up, farm boy?

428
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,430
你们三个好好玩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You three play nice.

429
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,840
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Hood.

430
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,710
好吧  别担心  我来搞定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, don't worry. I got this.

431
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,720
我不会告发你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not gonna turn you in.

432
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,350
不是因为我不想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not because I don't want to,

433
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,650
而是因为真相会让这个警局崩溃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but because the truth would annihilate this department.

434
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:10,670
它会让所有真警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It would wipe away

435
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,450
在这里做的努力都付之东流
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all the good work real cops have done around here.

436
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,370
你知道我想好好做警察的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know I tried to do good with that badge.

437
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:26,040
那个警徽从来就不是你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That badge was never yours to wear.

438
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,990
兔子曾是你的老板吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rabbit was your boss?

439
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,480
你曾为他偷窃过吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You stole for him?

440
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes.

441
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,380
还有卡莉·霍普韦尔  你们曾是...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And Carrie Hopewell, the two of you were...

442
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,930
-是的  -天哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yes. - Jesus.

443
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,710
为什么是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why me?

444
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,770
西沃恩  不管你怎么想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Siobhan, no matter what you think,

445
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,080
但我们的感情是真的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you and me was not a lie.

446
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,090
西沃恩  我向上帝发誓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Siobhan, I swear to God.

447
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,910
我唯一觉得安全的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The only time I ever felt safe

448
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,970
就是和你在一起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}was with you.

449
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,090
我信任你  我接纳了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I trusted you. I let you in.

450
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,890
-我懂  -你使我的生命职业都处于险境  我还不知情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I know. - You endangered my life, my career, and I let you.

451
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,260
-西沃恩  -不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Siobhan. - No.

452
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,530
你他妈别碰我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't fuckin' touch me.

453
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,330
我告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is what you're gonna do.

454
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,790
你现在出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're gonna go out there right now,

455
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,220
录完普罗科特的口供
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you're gonna finish booking Proctor,

456
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,010
然后悄悄地辞职
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and then you're gonna quietly resign.

457
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,570
然后呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then what?

458
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,530
然后你离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then you're gonna walk away.

459
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,140
趴下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get down!
