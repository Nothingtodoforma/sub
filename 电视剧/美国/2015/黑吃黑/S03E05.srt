1
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,200
你在想什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you thinking about?

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,600
我在想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was thinking about something

3
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,300
前几天有人跟我说的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}someone said to me the other day.

4
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,350
当人们习惯了某种生活方式
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, you get used to a certain way of being.

5
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,970
然后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And...

6
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,150
是会觉得就这样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you think we are who we are

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
还是会觉得能继续改变
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or you think we can change?

8
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,650
你是说你这种人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, you mean people like you?

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,360
我  你  所有人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, me, you, people in general.

10
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,780
我不知道人会不会真的改变
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know if anyone ever changes, really,

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,250
但总会改进  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but we can evolve, right?

12
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,540
我们一直以来都在为此努力  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, that's what we're trying to do, isn't it?

13
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,040
努力做更好的自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just become better versions of ourselves.

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,840
趴下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get down!

15
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,650
趴下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get down!

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,520

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Medicine will help the pain.

19
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,960
凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kai.

20
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,960
原谅我  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Forgive me, Kai.

21
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,130
如果我能再坚强一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I had only been stronger,

22
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,170
我就能拯救你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I could have saved you.

23
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,100
拯救我们两个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Could have saved us both.

24
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,450
凯  你在哪里  我是艾米丽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kai, where are you? It's Emily.

25
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,410
你需要马上回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You need to come home now.

26
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,500
别起身
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay down.

27
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,090
-你去哪儿  -不能让他们进来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Where are you going? - Can't let them get inside.

28
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,770
阿尔玛  你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alma, you good?

29
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,200

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think so.

30
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,360
好  别起身
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, stay down.

31
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,370
阿尔玛  快打开无线电
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hh Alma, get on the radio.

32
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,590
无线电坏了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Radio's fried.

33
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,890
试试电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Try the landline.

34
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
-电话没反应  -他们在干扰  继续打
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- The phones are dead. - And they're jamming cells, too. Keep trying.

35
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,220

没出血  没出血
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No blood. No blood.

41
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,470
没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You okay?

42
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,700
我...我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-- I understand that

43
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,160
我的样子可能有点让人不安  但...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}my physical appearance may be unsettling, but...

44
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,650
算了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Never mind.

45
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,560
那是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the hell was that?

46
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,660
我还以为是你带来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought he was with you.

47
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,820
-警长  放我出去  -给我闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Sheriff, get me out. - Shut the fuck up.

48
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,510
换弹  集合
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Load and regroup.

49
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,790
下一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Next one!

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,520
-布罗克  -去弄点水  来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Brock. - See if we can get you some water. Yeah.

51
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,540
快把我从这破笼子里放出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get me out of is goddamn cage right now!

52
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,780
闭嘴  普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shut up, Proctor.

53
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,710
你没看到吗  我们出了点状况
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you haven't noticed, we got a bit of a situation.

54
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,260
这里没有掩护
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have no cover in here!

55
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,970
我们的掩护都一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've got the same cover we all have.

56
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,760
如果我想进来  那几扇门可挡不住我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I wanted to get in here, those gates wouldn't stop me.

57
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,470
你早就进来了是件好事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it's a good thing you're already in here.

58
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,180
是红骨帮的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, it's the Redbones.

59
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,810
停车场和街道对面都是他们的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're spread out in the parking lot and across the street.

60
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,860
我们得抵挡住他们  等州警前来支援
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We just need to hold them off till the state police get here.

61
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,910
州警不会来  电话打不出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, they're not coming. Phones are down.

62
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,670
-手机也是吗  -对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Cells, too? - Yeah.

63
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,400
该死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, shit.

64
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,480
好吧  那现在我们基本只能靠自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, so we're basically on our own

65
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,550
来对付那帮杀人狂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}against a homicidal maniac

66
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,280
以及十来个全副武装的暴徒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and a dozen thugs armed like a platoon.

67
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,970
-差不多吧  -他们到底要干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- That about sums it up. - What the fuck do they want?

68
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,210
我不知道  但无论如何我们肯定不会喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know, but whatever it is, we're not gonna like it.

69
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,340
他们要的是我  我杀了汤米
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They want me. I killed Tommy.

70
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,900
我才不在乎谢顿要什么  他不会如愿的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don’t give a fuck what Chayton wants. He's not get.

71
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,270
雷文  西沃恩  带平民去地下室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Raven, Siobhan, get these civilians down to the basement.

72
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,170
好了  大家跟我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, folks. Come with us.

73
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,190
咱们去个安全的地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're gonna take you someplace safe.

74
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,660
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You all right?

75
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,740
没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I'm fine.

76
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,390
外面怎么回事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell's going on out there?

77
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,670
我猜他们冲破大门了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm guessing these gates thrown

78
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,230
正在重新部署  制定下一步计划
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and they're regrouping, figuring out their next move.

79
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,870
你的下一步计划是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's your next move?

80
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,890
不知道这些门还能挡多久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know how long those

81
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,470
我们需要更多火力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}gates are gonna last. We need more firepower.

82
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,450
去军械库  把能找到的都拿来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go down to the armory, get everything you can.

83
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,910
这些够吗  希望你不介意  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is this enough? I hope you don't mind, Sheriff;

84
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,360
我私自行动了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I took some initiative.

85
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,670
我估计时间紧迫
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Figured there was no time to waste.

86
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,310
你就是之前给我简历的家伙  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're the guy who gave me your resume, right?

87
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,820
戴德郡警署的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dade County Sheriff's Department.

88
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,300

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How the hell did you get into our gun locker, Bunker?

90
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,230
我把锁砸了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I smashed the lock.

91
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,040
-你被录用了  -什么

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,470
-普罗科特先生怎么办  -他怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What about Mr. Proctor? - What about him?

95
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,850
让他待在牢房里侵犯了他的公民自由权
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Keeping him in that cell is a violation to civil liberty.

96
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,090
那是因为他太渣了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

97
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,330
-警长  你到底放不放他  -不放
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Sheriff, you're gonna let him out or not? - Not.

98
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,100
好  那就是说警长意图
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, so the sheriff is

99
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,370
让我的委托人承受生命危险
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}willfully endangering the life of my client.

100
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,050
你是法院职员  快行动起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're an officer of the court. Do something.

101
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,820
这里是战争区域  律师
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Th is a war zone, Counselor.

102
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,530

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Due process just got blown up.

103
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,580
斯柏林  我有个主意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Sperling, I got an idea.

104
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,400
不然你也去地下室吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you go down the basement?

105
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,680
没有普罗科特先生  我哪也不去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not fucking going anywhere without Mr. Proctor.

106
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,980
好吧  邦克  给他把枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, Bunker, give him a gun.

107
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,540
什么  为什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? Why?

108
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,850
你也该派上点用场了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Time to make yourself useful.

109
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,770
我不会开枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know how to shoot that thing.

110
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,530
我也不会  但我会拿起枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, neither do I but it's not gonna stop me.

111
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,160
女士  那把枪后坐力很大
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ma'am, that gun packs a powerful kick.

112
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,090
你是要站在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you gonna stand there

113
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,860

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}like a total misogynist and patronize me,

114
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,970
还是要教教我怎么用这玩意儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or are you gonna show me how to shoot the damn thing?

115
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,310
谢谢你  我又体会到婚姻的乐趣了  来吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you. I just felt married again. All right, here we go.

116
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,320
弹夹放这里  看到没
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Magazine goes right in here, all right?

117
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,460
一定记得打开保险
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Make sure the safety is off.

118
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,090
放进枪膛  然后对准  射击
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One in the chamber, and just point and squeeze.

119
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,030
需要的话可以重复几遍  胡德  地下室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Repeat as necessary. Hood, the basement.

120
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,170
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What about it?

121
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,290
紧急出口外没有闸门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The exterior doors don't have gates on them.

122
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,190
邦克  穿过交火区去楼下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bunker, through the range down the stairs.

123
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,780
收到  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm on it. Sir.

124
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,900
-艾莉森  你和...  -我才不跟这家伙一起行动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Alison. You're going with... - I'm not going anywhere with that guy.

125
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,390
恕我直言  女士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}With all due respect, ma'am,

126
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,610
我明白我的外貌让人不放心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I understand my physical appearance may be alarming--

127
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,120
省省吧  你这种人我见多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Save it. I've known men like you.

128
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,540
我了解你这种人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know everything about you.

129
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,040
你想帮助别人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, you wan to help people.

130
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,550
下面的人正需要你的帮助
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's people down there who need your help.

131
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,890
那就让纳粹小子去安抚他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then let the Nazi calm them down.

132
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,150
我是在跟你说话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm asking you.

133
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,830
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine.

134
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,390
不过离我远点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But keep your distance,

135
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,370
鉴于我是新手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I am new with this thing,

136
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,680
这玩意儿说不定会走火
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so it might just accidentally go off.

137
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,310
你没意见吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fair enough?

138
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,320
没有  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, sir.

139
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,840
平民都躲在地下室了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Citizens are secure in the basement.

140
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,370
现在要怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do we do now?

141
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,110
各自散开  找好隐蔽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, spread out, settle in.

142
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,710
冲进门来的一律射杀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You shoot anything that comes through those gates.

143
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,150
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

144
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,900
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

145
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,740
我在听呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm listening.

146
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,540
比利·雷文和普罗科特都在里面
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've got Billy Raven and Proctor in there.

147
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,420
让他俩出来  再放了纳兹和泰特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Send them both out with Nazi and Tate,

148
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,310
我就放过其他人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and we'll spare the rest of you.

149
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,100
我想想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me think about.

150
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,560
给你两分钟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got two minutes.

151
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,540
警长  你不是在认真考虑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff, you are not seriously considering

152
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,890
把普罗科特先生交给那个疯子吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}handing Mr. Proctor over to that psychopath?

153
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,660
放松  杰克逊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Relax, Jackson.

154
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,340
我相信警长不会忘记
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sure the sheriff hasn't forgotten the night

155
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,240
那个与此相似的夜晚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}much like this one when he would have die

156
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,140
那晚要不是我他早就死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}if not for my intervention.

157
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,170
警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff?

158
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,640
谢顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Chayton.

159
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,500
-我不答应  -不会给你第二次机会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Can't do it. - You won't get another chance.

160
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,750
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that right?

161
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,250
告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell you what.

162
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,040
你现在滚蛋  就放你一条生路
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You leave now, I let you live.

163
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,540
我们会进去的  小警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are coming in there, cop.

164
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,250
也许吧  但如果你进来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe, but if you do,

165
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,770
更多的红骨帮成员就会死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}more Redbones are gonna die.

166
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,950
死了你弟弟还不够吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wasn't your little brother enough?

167
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,740
给我闭嘴  白人小子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shut your mouth, white boy.

168
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,720
你真应该好好保护他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, you really should have protected him more.

169
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,260
我会让你痛不欲生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna make you suffer.

170
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,890
谢顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Chayton.

171
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,650
给我滚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck off.

172
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,010
如果门被弄开  我们坚持不了多久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If those gates come down, we won't last long.

173
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,710
还剩多少弹药
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How much ammo we got left?

174
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,350
反正不够
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not enough.

175
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,480
警长  让我跟谢顿谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff, let me talk to Chayton.

176
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,150
他不想跟你谈  比利
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He doesn't want to talk to you, Billy.

177
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,010
-他想杀了你  -我可以结束这一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He wants to kill you. - I could end this.

178
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,280
怎么结束  牺牲你自己吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, by sacrificing yourself?

179
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,110
-这是部落的规矩  -这是狗屁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It's tribal justice. - No, bullshit is what it is.

180
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,630
要死一起死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We go down, we go down together.

181
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,720
这下糟了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, this sucks.

182
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,510
-谁要手电  西沃恩  -我抽屉里有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Who needs a light? Siobhan? - I got one in my drawer.

183
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,390
-比利  你有手电吗  -有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Billy? You got it? - Got it.

184
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,360
-布罗克  -拿着这个  走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hey, Brock! - Here, take it. Go.

185
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,510
应急照明灯呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's the emergency lights?

186
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,180
-我们没有应急照明灯  -真棒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- We don't have emergency lights. - Perfect.

187
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,970
-操  都蹲下  -见鬼了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Fuck. Stay down. - Shit.

188
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,050
你是在浪费时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're wasting your time.

189
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,850
谢顿不久就会想出办法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At some point Chayton is gonna wise up

190
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,060
他会把门弄开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and he's gonna pull those gates off the hinges.

191
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,910
然后把你生吞活剥了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then he's gonna eat you alive.

192
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,400
我可以把你送出去给他当开胃菜啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I could always send you out there as an appetizer.

193
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,420
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

194
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,110
我宁愿在外面为了活命放手一搏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I'd rather fight for my life out there

195
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,620
也不愿像你们一样  在黑暗中等死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}than wait in the dark to die like the rest of you.

196
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,000
他说的有道理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's got a point.

197
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,140
胡德  听着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood, listen.

198
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,380
地下室里有备用发电机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a backup generator in the basement.

199
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,470
不能完全恢复供电  但能有照明
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Won't power everything, but it'll buy us some light.

200
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,800
-我去  -好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'll go. - Okay.

201
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,780
-是谁  -西沃恩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Who's there? - Siobhan.

202
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,210
他们把灯都关了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They took out the lights.

203
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,770
故意吓唬我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're trying to mess with our heads.

204
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,120
的确起效了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it's working.

205
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,770
好了  挺好  有人听到了枪声
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, listen. Someone heard that gunfire.

206
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,970
所以州警已经在来的路上了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay? So the state police, they're on the way.

207
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,220
在他们到这之前  希望你们可以团结起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Till they get here, I need you to hang tight.

208
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,640
能做到吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can you do that?

209
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,970
很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good.

210
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,690
西沃恩  来处理发电机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Siobhan, take care of that generator.

211
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,870
没动静吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All quiet?

212
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,520
目前是的  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So far, sir.

213
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,430
你一直这么有礼貌吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You always so polite?

214
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,220
紧张的时候才这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Only when I'm nervous.

215
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,540
-挺住  邦克  -是  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hang in there, Bunker. - Yes, sir.

216
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,570
-该死  -没有油了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Oh, shit. - Out of gas?

217
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,380
就一点儿了  给  举着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Almost. Here, hold this.

218
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,680
他妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God damn it.

219
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,440
-你举着  我来  -不用  我可以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Here, let me try. - No, I got it.

220
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,240
-给我  -我说了我可以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Come on. - I said I got it!

221
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,460
这倒霉日子简直倒霉到家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This fucking day just keeps getting worse.

222
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,740
你觉得我是什么感觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How do you think I feel?

223
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,550
我都要退休了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was about to retire.

224
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,090
你是个混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're an asshole.

225
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,320
对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

226
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,670
你都不知道你在这干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't even know what you're doing here.

227
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,240
甚至都不是警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not even a cop.

228
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,500
对  我不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I'm not.

229
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,560
那我们他妈的为什么要听你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then why the fuck are we all listening to you?

230
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,880
知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what?

231
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,480
你说得对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're right.

232
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,220
但我经历过更恐怖的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I've been in tighter spots than this

233
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,940
而我还活着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I'm still here.

234
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,750
所以我需要你相信我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So I need you to trust me.

235
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,580
你知道那听起来有多可笑吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds?

236
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,760
知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes.

237
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,700
我不想死在今晚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't want to die tonight.

238
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,030
你不会死的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not going to.

239
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,820
我们会一起走出去的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're all walking out of this together.

240
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,220
我们再试一遍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's try it again.

241
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,480
谢天谢地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, thank God.

242
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,250
这已经不是第一次了  知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This isn't the first time this has happened, you know?

243
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,990
一伙带着机关枪的人已经够糟了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, one army of guys with machine guns would be bad enough.

244
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,450
结果来两伙  简直是...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But two? I mean, that's just...

245
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,050
霉运当头
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bad luck?

246
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,540
不  不是这样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, it's something else.

247
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,000
天啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus.

248
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,400
-给  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Here. - Thank you.

249
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,850
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks.

250
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,830
这里太安静了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's so quiet in here.

251
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,730
你觉得他们走了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You think they left?

252
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,540
谢顿不会离开的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton's not going anywhere.

253
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,630
不达目的不会离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not till he gets what he wants.

254
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,350
不  他们会很快就离开的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, they'll make a move soon.

255
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,800
希望我...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wish I had-- -

256
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,120
斯柏林
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sperling!

257
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,840
你他妈在干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell are you doing?

258
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,690
我在帮我的委托人脱离危险
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm getting my client out of harm's way.

259
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,040
钥匙给我  杰克逊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me the keys, Jackson.

260
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,030
-见鬼  -趴下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Blow me. - Get down!

261
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,630
-操  -他妈的快把钥匙给我  杰克逊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Shit! - Give me the fucking keys, Jackson.

262
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,540
-滚开  艾莉森  -快把钥匙给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Fuck off, Alison. - Give me the fucking keys!

263
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,380
过来  过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, hey. Come on. Come on.

264
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,150
雷文在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's Raven?

265
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,950
-布罗克  雷文在哪  -那边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Brock, where's Raven? - In there.

266
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,070
-瑞文  -在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Raven! - Yeah?

267
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,370
掩护我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cover me!

268
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,830
-趴下  趴下  -快跑  隐蔽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Down! Down! - Come on, move! Take cover!

269
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,470
我们得把缺口堵上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's get this hole covered up.

270
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,650
普罗科特在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's Proctor?

271
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,480
显然他的律师把他放跑了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Apparently his lawyer got him an early release.

272
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,390
-什么  -帮我一下  帮我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What? - Help me. Help me.

273
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,460
坚持住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on.

274
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:19,440
那些撑不了多久的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Those aren't gonna hold them off for long.

275
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,990
没错  但比什么都没有强
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, but it's better than nothing.

276
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,270
-那是什么声音  -不知道  呆在这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What is that? - I don't know. Stay here.

277
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,090
开始吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's do it.

278
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,510
你会找我麻烦吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We gonna have a problem?

279
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,420
不  今晚不会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, not tonight.

280
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:23,280
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}主祷文念诵

281
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,280
像我们宽恕我们的敌人一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}As we forgive those who trespass against us.

282
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,630
不教我们遇见试探
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And lead us not into temptation,

283
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,360
救我们脱离恶者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but deliver us from evil.

284
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,970
因为国度
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For Thine is the kingdom,

285
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,540
权力和荣耀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the power and the glory,

286
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,910
都属于你  直到永远
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}forever and ever.

287
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,940
阿门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Amen.

288
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,830
上  上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go! Go!

289
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,330
-散开散开  -快  快
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Stand clear! - Move! Move!

290
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,420
快灭火
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put it out!

291
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,160
我能感觉到你在看着我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can feel you looking at me.

292
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,820
-你还好吗  -我没事  不用担心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Are you okay? - I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

293
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,870
我不是你想象的那种人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not who you think I am.

294
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,010
是吗  可不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, really? Right.

295
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,920
-我猜你变了  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I guess you've changed. - Yes.

296
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,400
人是不会变的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}People don't change.

297
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,060
我16岁的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When I was 16,

298
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,170
亲眼看着我父亲被两个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I watched my father beaten into a coma

299
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,710
和你一样的男人殴打  昏迷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}by two men who looked just like you.

300
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,290
你知道那是什么感觉吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you have any idea what that feels like?

301
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,300
看着自己的父亲渺小无助鲜血淋淋的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To watch your father helpless and bleeding,

302
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,130
求着两个恶棍放过他唯一的女儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}begging two thugs to spare his only daughter.

303
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,420
他们没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They didn't.

304
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,290
没放过我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, spare me.

305
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,710
那你说  邦克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So tell me, Bunker,

306
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,780
是什么让一个男人充满仇恨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}what fills a man with so much hate

307
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,080
以至于他把这些仇恨永久的纹满全身
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that he has to permanently paint it all over his body?

308
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,360
向全世界宣告他的仇恨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Announce to the world that he hates something that much?

309
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,220
我父亲曾是我生活中最强大的男人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My father was the biggest man I ever knew.

310
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,570
我小的时候他经常打我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He beat me a lot when I was a kid,

311
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,530
所以我尽量不回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I stayed away from home as much as possible.

312
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:41,540
以前我有点结巴  很严重
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had a stutter, a really bad one,

313
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,080
所以我也很少说话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I didn't talk much either.

314
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,330
我家附近有一个叫汤克的邻居
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There was this guy in our neighborhood, Tank.

315
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,300
块头很大  是个全身纹身的恶棍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Big and badass and covered in tattoos.

316
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,850
每次他看见我  都会陪我坐着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And every time he saw me, he would sit me down

317
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,230
还给我买汽水喝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and buy me a soda.

318
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,400
告诉我  我有力量来改变这些
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me that I had the power to change things.

319
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,030
他把我介绍给他的弟兄们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Introduced me to his buddies.

320
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,850
只有他们让我觉得还有人在意我的存在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They were the only people that made me feel like I mattered.

321
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,800
有一天  我的父亲把我的眼睛打青了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One day, my father gave me a black eye.

322
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,340
我不记得原因了  但是汤克看到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't remember why, but Tank saw it.

323
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,240
他送我回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He marched me home,

324
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,220
掐住我父亲的喉咙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he grabbed my father by the throat,

325
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,050
逼他道歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}made him apologize.

326
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,400
让他保证再也不会动我一根汗毛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Made him promise he would never do it again.

327
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:40,730
他说  你儿子现在是我们的一员了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He said, "Your boy is one of us now."

328
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,810
我父亲再也没敢动过我一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My father never laid a hand on me again.

329
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,050
我第一次觉得自己有了力量
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For the first time I had power.

330
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,190
在我意识到之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And before I knew it...

331
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,960
就已经成为其中一员了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had become one of them.

332
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,820
不要找任何借口
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That is no goddamn excuse.

333
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,120
我明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know that.

334
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,650
我当然明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know that.

335
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,980
放下枪  普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Drop it, Proctor!

336
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,240
不用  布罗克  没关系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, Brock, it's okay.

337
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,930
去你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The hell it is.

338
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,170
放下你的武器  给我放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now drop your weapon. Drop it!

339
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,190
-别用你的枪指着我  -我让你放下枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Get that fucking gun out of my face. - I said drop it!

340
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,510
我跟你是一个战线的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm on your side!

341
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,500
冷静点  外面的才是敌人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, hey, hey! The fight's out there.

342
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,700
一个小时前  你用锤子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}An hour ago, I stopped you

343
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,690
揍这个混蛋被我阻止了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}from braining this asshole with a fucking hammer.

344
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,390
现在你想让他为所欲为吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now you're letting him do whatever the hell he wants?

345
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,230
在我的地盘上可不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. Not in my house.

346
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,060
这不是你的地盘
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not your house.

347
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,410
-这就是我的底盘  -别他妈的碰我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It is my fucking house! - Don't you fucking touch me.

348
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,800
你他妈的给了普罗科特一把枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You gave Proctor a goddamn gun.

349
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,910
你是不是在逗我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you kidding me?

350
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,950
他本来就有枪  我给了他些子弹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He had the gun. I gave him some ammo.

351
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:28,140
-为什么  -因为需要援助
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Why? - Because we need all the help we can get.

352
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,980
不不不  我不稀罕他的帮助
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, no, no. I don't want his help.

353
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:30,770
我不需要他的帮助
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't need his help.

354
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,260
我要把这个杀人犯关在监狱里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want that murderer locked up in a cell.

355
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,660
-这才是我要的  -这是我下的命令
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- That's what I need. - It was my call and I made it.

356
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,800
是  这的确是你的命令
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, of course it was your call.

357
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,930
无视法律  无视规则
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, forget the law, forget the rules.

358
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,710
想怎么做就怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just make it up as you go, huh?

359
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,020
-你冷静点  -去你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hey, just calm down. - No, fuck that!

360
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,050
不断有人在丧命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}People are dying

361
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,980
接下来可能是我们其中一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and any one of us could be next.

362
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,090
-听我说  -你知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Listen to me. - No, you know what?

363
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,030
事实就是你每次行动仓促
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The fact is you go off half-cocked whenever it suits you

364
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,860
我们还要在后面给你擦屁股
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and the rest of us just have to fight your battles.

365
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,280
我受够了  我以后再也不会听从你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I'm done. I've had it, I'm not listening to you anymore.

366
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,990
好啊  可以  把你的徽章还给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, fine. Give me your fuckin' badge.

367
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,280
我的徽章
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My badge?

368
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,580
知道吗  在你来之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, before you got here,

369
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,750
我兢兢业业的工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I did this job by the book.

370
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,050
付出了很多时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I put in my time,

371
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,530
还因此和老婆离了婚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I sacrificed my marriage for this job

372
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,330
就因为这是我的长处
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}because I'm good at it.

373
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,640
我干警察干得很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm good at being a cop.

374
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,550
会杀人不代表能胜任这份工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Being good at killing people doesn't make you right for this job.

375
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,710
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that right?

376
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,780
因为你杀人杀的也不错啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'Cause you're pretty fucking good at doing that, too.

377
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,550
是  是的  我试过了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah. Yeah. I did. I tried.

378
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,100
我试过了  胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I tried, Hood.

379
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,990
我试着按你的方式来做事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I tried doing things your way.

380
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,510
我说服我自己这是最正确的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I convinced myself it was for the best,

381
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,480
但你所到之处血流成河
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but everything you touch turns to blood.

382
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,660
带大家去另一间房
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get everyone in the other room now!

383
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,490
快快  出去  去另一间房
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go, go! Get out! Other room, go!

384
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,800
快  快  快
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go, go, go!

385
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,130
要命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck.

386
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,570
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, you all right?

387
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,450
没事  不要担心我  守住门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, don't worry about me. Just cover the door.

388
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,810
不断有人丧命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}People are dying.

389
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,850
你所到之处血流成河
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything you touch turns to blood.

390
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,510
你连自己在做什么都不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't even know what you're doing here.

391
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,860
你不配当个警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not even a cop.

392
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,750
-我要出去  -你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm going out there. - What the hell are you talking about?

393
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,980
必须有人去确认支援已经来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Someone's gotta make sure help is on the way.

394
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,860
胡德  这简直是自杀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood, it's suicide.

395
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,120
他说的没错  你会死在外面的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's right, you'll die out there.

396
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,920
你连站都站不稳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can barely even stand.

397
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,540
我们拖延不了多久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We can't hold them off forever.

398
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,670
想个别的办法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Find another way.

399
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,760
我去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll go.

400
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,530
一旦我们安全了  我就寻求帮助
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Once we're clear, I'll call for help.

401
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,620
你不会安全的  30秒内你就要死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You won't get clear. You'll be dead inside of 30 seconds.

402
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,500
不管怎样都是你赢  副警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, either way you win, Deputy.

403
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,220
听着  你被捕了  普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what? You're under arrest, Proctor.

404
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,070
不准你走出这扇门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't get to just walk out this door.

405
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,390
没退路了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Desperate times.

406
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,840
没错吧  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right, Sheriff?

407
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,220
一路顺风
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Godspeed.

408
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,440
如果我死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I don't make it outta here,

409
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,270
你他妈的离丽贝卡越远越好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you stay the fuck away from Rebecca.

410
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,280
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

411
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,510
如果我活下来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I do make it,

412
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,250
你我的事还没完
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you and I have unfinished business.

413
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,420
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I know.

414
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,110
冲出去了别忘了打电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't forget to make that call.

415
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,680
好了  我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on. Let's go.

416
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,850
堵上这扇门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's block up this door.

417
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,310
现在还不晚  丽贝卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not too late, Rebecca.

418
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,140
离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Leave this house.

419
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,670
自求谋生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Find your own way.

420
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,600
自求谋生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Find your own way.

421
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,650
雷文守着大房间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Raven's covering the bullpen.

422
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,450
布罗克和邦克在楼下守门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brock's downstairs watching the door with Bunker.

423
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,470
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

424
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,950
你觉得普罗科特做到了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You think Proctor made it?

425
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,490
做到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I do.

426
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,540
我们拥有的一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What we had...

427
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,980
有真实的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}was any of it real?

428
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,700
所有都是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All of it.

429
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,740
你确定吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you sure?

430
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,610
你被关了多久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How long were you locked up?

431
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,160
十五年
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}15 years.

432
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,600
天呐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God.

433
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,740
然后你到这儿发现卡莉找了戈登养儿育女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then you come here and Carrie's got Gordon and the kids.

434
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,820
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's right.

435
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,550
那现在呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And now?

436
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,890
你真的就想这么一走了之吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Would you really just have walked away?

437
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:50,980
如果你想的话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If that's what you want.

438
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,810
如果我不想呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What if it isn't?

439
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,870
那我俩一起走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then we leave together.

440
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,880
我了解你的一切了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do I know everything about you?

441
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,210
没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not yet.

442
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,060
但如果你想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if you want to...

443
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,660
你就会了解
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you will.

444
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,310
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

445
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,830
那你先告诉我你的真名
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Start by telling me your real name.
