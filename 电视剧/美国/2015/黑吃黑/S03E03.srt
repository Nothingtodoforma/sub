{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Banshee S03E03

2
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,950
你说你留在女妖镇是为了我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You told me you stayed in Banshee because of me.

3
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,740
我是想确保你没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had to make sure you were okay.

4
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,440
我有事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not.

5
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,620
听着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, listen.

6
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
被枪指着你好像一点都不惊讶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't seem surprised to have a gun in your face.

7
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,180
这说明你一直都过的小心谨慎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's a symptom of a life spent looking over your shoulder.

8
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,360
你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who are you?

9
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,760
我是特别探员罗伯特·菲利普斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm Special Agent Robert Phillips,

10
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,380
联邦调查局内部调查组
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}FBI Internal Investigations.

11
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,990
我都不知道联调局里还有内务
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I didn't realize the FBI had internal affairs.

12
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,970
那是因为你不是真正的警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's because you're not really a cop.

13
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,180
不过我们有大把的时间好好聊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But we'll have plenty of time to talk about all that later.

14
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,850
先去穿好衣服
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you get dressed?

15
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,000
很久以前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There was a time

16
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,240
是我站在床边凝视你的睡颜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when I was the one who would watch you sleep.

17
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,600
你曾是个漂亮的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You were such a beautiful child

18
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,530
前途一片光明
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with so much promise.

19
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,690
我从来没想让你失望  母亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was never my intention to disappoint you, Mother.

20
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,150
凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, Kai.

21
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,590
我不会对你失望的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You could never disappoint me.

22
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,340
我只是希望我能相信
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just wish I could believe

23
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,990
你得到了满足
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you were content.

24
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,140
谁还会爱你呢  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who will love you, Kai?

25
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
你还会爱谁呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who will you love?

26
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,940
普罗科特先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mr. Proctor?

27
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,150
我  我只是想确认你没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-- I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

28
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,500
你要保证  我离开之后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Promise me after I am gone...

29
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,230
你会让丽贝卡搬出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that you will move Rebecca out of this house.

30
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,860
这不合适  这不健康
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not proper. It's not healthy.

31
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,430
你保证
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Promise me.

32
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,300
我不该扔下她的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should never have left her.

33
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,560
我不该把她扔在农场里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should never have left her on the farm

34
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,320
和我父亲一起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with my father.

35
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,580
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's okay.

36
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,390
她需要我  这些年来  她需要...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She needed me. All those years, she needed...

37
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,880
她现在仍需要你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She still needs you.

38
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,190
而你就在她身边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you're here for her.

39
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,840
你好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi there.

40
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,710
知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know,

41
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,690
听说通过家里的样子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}they say a man's home is

42
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,770
就能了解主人的内心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a window into his mind.

43
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,650
是  我听过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I've heard that.

44
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,280
格洛克17
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Glock 17.

45
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,390
9毫米口径
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}9 mil.

46
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,020
真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Really?

47
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,400
对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

48
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,050
是我的得力助手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gets the job done.

49
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,450
你应该了解我的几件事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should know some things about me.

50
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,900
我的上司要求结果
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My superiors demand results,

51
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,160
但他们并不关心是怎么得来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but they're not in the least concerned how I achieve them.

52
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,310
所以如果我是你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So if I were you,

53
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,140
我会加强警觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would exercise some caution.

54
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,890
如果我是你  也一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And if I were you, I'd do the same.

55
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,840
同意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Agreed.

56
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,340
那就戴上吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you put those on?

57
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,840
你就是普罗科特的看门恶犬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you're Proctor's big bad watchdog.

58
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,210
在我看来  你也没有多凶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't look so tough from where I'm standing.

59
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,350
计划是这样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So here's the plan.

60
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,110
首先  我会杀了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}First, I'm gonna kill you.

61
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,720
然后我要进去慢慢折磨死你老板
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then I'm going inside and I'm gonna slowly gut your boss

62
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,930
和他那《草原小屋》里的侄女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and his "Little House on the Prairie" niece.

63
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,340
我不这么想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't think so.

64
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,770
诺拉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nola.

65
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,410
让我死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me die.

66
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,380
你已经死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You already did.

67
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,090
是重生的时候了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's time to start living again.

68
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,240
数据回收器是什么玩意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell is a data skimmer?

69
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,940
物如其名
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Exactly what it sounds like.

70
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,440
它会扫描并储存从编码智能卡得来的元数据
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It scans and saves metadata from encoded smart cards.

71
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,300
我们从他们那窃取真实身份信息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We stealing real IDs from them

72
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,780
然后我就能给我们做假的了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I can make fake IDs for us.

73
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,860
早这么说不就完了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's all you had to say.

74
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,430
费那劲干嘛  现在干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

75
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,600
天知道这事从不简单
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lord knows it ain't ever easy.

76
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,730
这个给你  现在要让你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This one's yours. Now, I want you to--

77
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,080
测试
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Testing!

78
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,830
好用
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It works.

79
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,900
努力点  别给我搞砸了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do your best not to fuck this up.

80

81
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,220
这周都三次了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That is the third time this week.

82
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,960
他们这是要干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You think they're trying to tell me something?

83
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,860
我需要六个身份信息
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need six IDs.

84
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,380
数的时候别动嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Try not to move your lips while you're counting.

85
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,340
好了  我该去取下来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, I got to grab it.

86
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,660
不行  还差三个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mm-mmm, three more.

87
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,510
没时间了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Running out of time.

88
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,370
还差一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One more.

89
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,190
我的一串钥匙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, I had some keys--

90
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,130
原来在这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, there they are.

91
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,260
-还差一个  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- One more. - Thank you.

92
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,410
够了  出来吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got it. Get your ass out.

93
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,880
我有个很重要的商谈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got a big business meeting

94
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,420
钥匙丢了就去不了了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I can't get nowhere without these keys, you know?

95
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,910
太感谢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you so much.

96
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,000
咋了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

97
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,050
既然我们不用过大厅
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If we were never going past the lobby,

98
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,470
你干嘛让我穿一身西装
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}why you got me wearing this damn suit?

99
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,760
因为没有休闲星期一的说法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'Cause there ain't no such thing as sweatpants Monday.

100
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,230
开车啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can drive.

101
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,430
我喜欢经典摇滚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I prefer classic rock,

102
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,820
但是乡村音乐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but something about country music

103
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,690
让人身心舒畅  不觉得吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that soothes the soul, don't you think?

104
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,030
你怎么找到我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How did you find me?

105
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,360
我在局里有一项专门的工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I have a rather specialized job at the Bureau.

106
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,510
我是个问题处理者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm a fixer of sorts,

107
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,430
我调查死亡及失踪的探员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I investigate dead and missing agents.

108
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,480
当然  失踪的那些基本上也都死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Of course, the missing ones almost always turn out to be dead, too.

109
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,310
比如吉姆·拉辛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Like Jim Racine?

110
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,110
然而我在纽约州北部的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Instead I found his body

111
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,670
一间旧农舍外面找到了他的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}outside an old farmhouse in upstate New York.

112
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,780
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Really?

113
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,730
他尸体的一部分吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, what was left of him.

114

115
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,770
他被烧得很惨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He was burned up pretty bad.

116
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,890
杀了他的混蛋却没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But not the slug that killed him.

117
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,100
九毫米口径格洛克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Glock 9 mil?

118
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,640
不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

119
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,940
点308口径步枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}.308 rifle round.

120
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,480
挺有意思啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Isn't that interesting?

121
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,420
他手里那份
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not as interesting as the

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,690
原来纽约市警察局的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, it turns out that the NYPD's

124
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,720
匿名钻石大盗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}John Doe Capital Diamond thief

125
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,480
竟然是宾夕法尼亚州
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}turned out to be the new sheriff

126
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,540
女妖镇的新警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}of Banshee, Pennsylvania?

127
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,020
太跳跃了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's quite a leap.

128
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,210
大概吧  但这件事越发有趣了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe, but the story gets better.

129
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,710
尤其是在教堂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Especially the part about the church,

130
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,030
火拼那部分
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the gunfight.

131
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,730
要超级有种
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, it takes some king-sized balls

132
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,320
才敢用那种方式干掉兔子吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to take on a guy like Rabbit in a way like that.

133
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,820
当我想到前科犯冒充警长时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And when I think about an ex-con posing as a sheriff,

134
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,870
我想也许这两个有种的家伙是同一人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}well, I think maybe those are the same big balls.

135
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,780
我受宠若惊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I'm flattered,

136
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,950
但你只是在浪费时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but you're wasting your time.

137
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,150
你很了解浪费时间这回事  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know something about wasted time, don't you?

138
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,630
我不理解  我是说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't get it. I mean,

139
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,530
你出来后随便去哪儿都行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you could have gone anywhere when you got out.

140
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,790
比如去天堂岛  在黑沙滩上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You could have found a black sand beach somewhere in paradise,

141
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,620
找个淡棕色美女夜夜笙歌
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a new golden brown senorita every night of the week.

142
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,630
天哪  要我我就这么干
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My God, that's what I would have done.

143
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,710
但你偏不  你跑来了女妖镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, not you. No. You came to Banshee.

144
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,210
你在偷走你十五年光阴的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You played dress-up right down the road

145
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,570
女人家街头玩起了变装
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}from the woman who stole 15 years of your life.

146
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,790
她一定很惹火
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She must be something.

147
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,510
不然就是你内心深处
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or else there's something inside of you

148
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,520
还想被惩罚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that still wants to be punished.

149
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,310
你觉得呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you think?

150
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,770
我觉得你话太多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think you talk too much.

151
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,320
我第三任前妻也是这么说的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's what my third ex-wife told me.

152
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,370
好了  出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, get out.

153
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,890
你要放我走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're letting me go?

154
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,510
不  我放你出来撒尿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I'm letting you take a piss.

155
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,870
回市里还有很长一段路
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's a long way back to the city.

156
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,160
中途不会再停车了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're not gonna stop another time.

157
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,160
-我不用  -我没问你  出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm good. - I'm not asking. Move.

158
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,030
-敢乱来的话  -知道  你就开枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- And if you try anything-- - Yeah, you'll shoot me.

159
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,480
-我懂的  -对  出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I get it. - Yeah. Come on.

160
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,900

-我改变主意了  -怎么说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I think I changed my mind. - How's that?

164
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,540
我不想回纽约
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I don't think I want to go back to New York.

165
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,510
说得好像你有的选一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You make it sound like you have a choice.

166
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,640
选择总会有的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, there's always a choice.

167
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,420
我想举报一起抢劫案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want to report a robbery in progress

168
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,450
在钻石仓库

今晚是我的人把你们扣下的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was my team that took you down tonight.

173
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,180
恭喜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Congratulations.

174
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,050
你很聪明  应该知道

177
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,330
可以吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}May I?

178
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,850
要喝点什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}May I offer you something to drink while you wait?

179
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,910
咖啡  茶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Coffee? Tea?

180
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,650
还是浓烈些的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Something stronger?

181
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,340
在我看来  你已经知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The way I see it, you know you got jail

182
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,100
我们已经没有谈话的必要了

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You aren't going home for many years.

185
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,900
该清醒了  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Time to wake up, asshole.

186
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,510
他醒了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There he is.

187
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,250
抱歉让你等这么久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry to keep you waiting.

188
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,200
但愿我的手下让你有宾至如归的感觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hopefully my associates have made you feel at home.

189
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,380
如你所见  对于我这种体型的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}As you can see, comfort is a priority

190
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,040
舒适是最重要的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for a man of my dimensions.

191
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,060
适当的旅游是必要的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Some travel is unavoidable,

192
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,410
但轿车  货车  飞机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but cars, vans, planes,

193
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,220
对我来说都是一种侮辱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}they all present indignities for me.

194
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,750
你可以试着偶尔吃点沙拉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, you could try eating a salad now and then.

195
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,220
我认为肥胖的玩笑不该存在于我们之间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think fat jokes are beneath us both.

196
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,830
这很难说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that's hard to say

197
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,930
鉴于我不知道你他妈到底是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}seeing as I have no idea who the fuck you are.

198
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,090
我的名字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My name

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,360

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brantley, that's the guy

201
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,230
你就是偷了他的钱  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you stole the money off, right?

202
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,000
听着  我看到了不该看到的东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, I saw some shit I wasn't supposed to see.

203
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,460
布兰特利是个偏执的疯子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brantley, Brantley is a paranoid fuck.

204
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,530
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes?

205
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,370
不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No?

206
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,620
也许
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe?

207
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:17,510
对于你我唯一确定的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The only thing I know for sure about you

208
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,130
是你不是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is who you are not.

209
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,830
你不是卢卡斯·胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you are not Lucas Hood.

210
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,910
对吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Isn't that right?

211
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,930
没关系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's okay.

212
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,490
除了之前的一顿暴打
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Despite a particularly nasty beating,

213

一直安静地像只老鼠
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}remained as quiet as a mouse.

215
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,460
杰森·胡德在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where is Jason Hood?

216
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,620
我不知道那是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have no idea who that is.

217
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,880
-真的吗  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Really? - Yes.

218
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,060
不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

219
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,940
也许
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe.

220
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,730
我...他死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I, just, he's dead.

221
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,900
他死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's dead.

222
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,770
他死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's de--

223
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,520
把杰森·胡德交给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me Jason Hood

224
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,360
然后菲利普斯探员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and Agent Phillips

225
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,610
再也不会找你的麻烦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}will never cause you discomfort again.

226
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,990
说实话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To tell you the truth,

227
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,260
我从没担心过菲利普斯探员的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've never really been worried about Agent Phillips.

228
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,690
所以你要是还摸得到自己的屌
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So if you can find your dick in there,

229
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,540
干嘛不滚回去自己打飞机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}why don't you go fuck yourself?

230
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:34,100
如果我是你  我会稍微考虑一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I were you, I'd take a moment to consider how tenuous

231
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,520
你有什么讨价还价的余地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your bargaining position truly is.

232
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,790
也许你的女孩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe you got a girl...

233
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,560
独自在黑暗中等待  想知道发生了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}alone in the dark waiting and wondering what happened.

234
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,400
我说过应该让我去普罗科特家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I told you I should have handled Proctor's house.

235
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,500
你的机会马上就来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'll get your chance soon enough.

236
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,230
你一直这么说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's what you keep saying.

237
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,000
让我去打他的七寸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me hit him where it hurts.

238
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,190
让普罗科特知道我们才是老大
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Show Proctor that we're in control.

239
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,820
你还没准备好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not ready.

240
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,440
别让我再提醒你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't make me tell you again.

241
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,560
切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton.

242
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,160
你们先出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You guys take a walk.

243
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,660
汤米
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Tommy.

244
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,030
高中后我从没这样过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I haven't been out this way since high school.

245
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,560
你本不该来这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should not have come here.

246
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,270
你为什么偷那些枪  切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why'd you steal those guns, Chayton?

247
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,900
如果我不知道实情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I didn't know any better,

248
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,830
我会说你是在训练军队
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'd say you were training an army.

249
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,830
不过那就太疯狂了  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But that would be crazy, right?

250
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,190
疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Crazy.

251
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,500
疯狂是让居留地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Crazy is allowing the reservation

252
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,740
变得和外界一样腐朽堕落
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to become as corrupt as the outside world.

253
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,920
-有多少  -不过朗西德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- How many-- - But that's just what Longshadow

254
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,470
和乔治·亨特已经这么做了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and George Hunter have done.

255
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,190
他们说我们是歹徒  是黑帮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They call us outlaws, gangbangers.

256
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,730
说得好像我们才是问题所在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Treat us like we're the problem.

257
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,370
那是因为你把暴力当做解决办法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because you treat violence like it's the solution.

258
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,160
为了防止家园落入普罗科特这种人手中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will do anything to protect our land

259
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,320
我愿意做任何事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}from men like Proctor.

260
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,310
你所做的只是在伤害自己人而已
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All you're doing is hurting more of our own.

261
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,300
这比任何一个人都重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is bigger than any one person.

262
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,500
你去跟死在普罗科特泳池里的那个红骨帮说吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell that to the dead Redbone they pulled out of Proctor's pool.

263
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,280
或者躺在重症监护室的那个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or the other one in the ICU.

264
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,470
正义之战总有伤亡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Casualties of a righteous war.

265
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,110
我们还是孩子的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, when we were kids

266
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,180
你和汤米搬来和我们住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you and Tommy came to live with us...

267
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,520
你那么害羞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you were so shy.

268
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,490
那么温柔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So gentle.

269
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,770
我跟所有人说你是我亲哥哥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I told everybody you were my real brother

270
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,930
因为我希望那是真的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}because I wanted it to be true.

271
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,180
现在我都快认不出你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now I barely recognize you.

272
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,900
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}库珀·杜鲁门运输

273
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,480
你还挺经打的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You sure can take a hell of a beating.

274
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,030
彼此彼此
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll give you that.

275
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,110
你为什么不说实话呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you just tell him the truth?

276
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,790
-他知道你在撒谎  -他什么都不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He knows you're lying. - He doesn't know shit.

277
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,760
-他以为我在撒谎  -有什么区别呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He thinks I'm lying. - What's the difference?

278
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,300
菲利普斯探员  这可是最基本的心理战术
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, Agent Phillips, that's basic psy-ops protocol.

279
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,970
要想扳倒敌人物理上的优势
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The only way to overcome a physical advantage

280
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,680
-就要建立心理上的优势  -心理上的优势
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- is to establish a psychological one. - A psychological one.

281
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,260
没错  记起来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There you go. You remember.

282
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,000
在匡提科上那节课时我睡过了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I slept through that class at Quantico.

283
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,440
你没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, you didn't.

284
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,220
你可以玩你喜欢的心理游戏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, you can play all the mind games you want,

285
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,470
但我们不可能活着离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but we're not leaving here alive.

286
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,030
你心里清楚  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know that, right?

287
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,660
要我说  待在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Way I see it, I'm better off in here

288
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,330
也比困在你车里好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}than I was in the back of your car.

289
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,320
如果这是真的  你得扪心自问一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, if that's really true, you have to ask yourself

290
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,950
你的三观有多么扭曲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}just how fucked up your universe really is.

291
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,710
我早就想过了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The thought has crossed my mind.

292
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,470
这些年来  我也击碎过不少
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I have cracked

293
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,210
扭曲的心灵  而你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}some pretty twisted minds in my time, but you--

294
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,210
你不想放过我  是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not gonna give up on me, are you?

295
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,510
绝不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not a chance.

296
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,910
说到哪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where were we?

297
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,640
你刚刚问我有关杰森·胡德的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You just asked me about Jason Hood.

298
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,400
你让我滚回去自己打飞机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you told me to go fuck myself.

299
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,940
我们都被绑起来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're all caught up.

300
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,950
我他妈会杀了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna fucking kill you.

301
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:13,090
艾米莉  是我  我打来问个好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Emily, it's me. Just checking in.

302
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,860
总之  回我电话  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anyway, call me back, all right?

303
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,610
-一切还好吧  -好得不能再好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Is everything okay? - Couldn't be better.

304
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,090
我要下班了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm, I'm clocking out.

305
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,980
有胡德的消息吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Any word from Hood?

306
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,530
没有  什么都没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nope. Nothing.

307
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,490
也许我们该把他的办公室改成游戏室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm thinking we should turn his office into a game room.

308
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,590
你说呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you think?

309
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,870
我其实有点担心他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm actually pretty worried.

310
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,620
我试着联系他一整天了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've been trying to reach him all day.

311
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,410
真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Really?

312
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,960
反正你的工作也跑不了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, your paperwork's not going anywhere.

313
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,390
不如去他家看看情况
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you head over to his place and see what's what?

314
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,640
-真的吗  -真的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah? - Yeah.

315
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,620
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

316
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,280
-谢谢  布罗克  -不用谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Thanks, Brock. - Sure.

317
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,140
找到他了告诉我一声
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me know when you find him.

318
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,340
-没问题  -好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- All right. - All right.

319
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,750
-你要走了吗  -是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You heading out? - Yep.

320
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,860
要去什么好地方吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anywhere good?

321
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,450
只是和老朋友一起喝杯酒而已
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, just having an afternoon drink with an old friend.

322
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,010
普莱特恩恩  我在想什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Platinumm, what the hell was I thinking?

323
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,310
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry.

324
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,070
跟热辣前妻搞上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, there is worse things

325
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,970
也不是世界末日
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}than getting some from your hot ex-wife.

326
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,070
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I know.

327
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,840
她总是反复无常  你不了解艾米莉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's always a flip side with her. You don't know Emily.

328
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,650
我只知道  没人逼你跟她上床
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know there's nobody forcing you to bump uglies with her.

329
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,530
这点没错  说得太对了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That is true. That is very true.

330
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,780
不过  事情没那么简单
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But, you know, it's, it's complicated.

331
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,760
男人总会把老二插进
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ugh, how come every time a guy goes sticking his dick

332
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,130
不该插的地方  这很复杂吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}someplace he shouldn't, it's complicated?

333
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,990
-我只是  -别说了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Well, I just... - No.

334
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,410
有时候当我...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, sometimes when I...

335
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,150
你的前妻很清楚自己在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your ex knows exactly what she's doing.

336
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,650
她把你训的服服帖帖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She's got you exactly where she wants you.

337
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,770
上了床就不知道自己是谁了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Losing your fucking mind over some bomb-ass pussy.

338
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,850
我明白  我明白  我明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know. I know. I know.

339
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,390
你是明白怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You already know what to do,

340
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,000
但你不会付诸行动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but you're not gonna do it.

341
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,860
你是个聪明的女人  普莱特恩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're a wise woman, Platinumm.

342
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:23,320
住手  白痴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, shithead!

343
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:26,460
杀了他  你们就什么都问不到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You kill him, you'll never get what you want.

344
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,360
菲利普斯探员说得对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Agent Phillips is right.

345
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:38,040
要不要告诉我他在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you gonna tell me where he is?

346
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,080
让他出去透透气
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give him some fresh air!

347
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,780
下午好  副警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Afternoon, Deputy.

348
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,470
来点什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can I get you something?

349
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,930
不了  谢谢  你看见警长了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, thanks. Have you seen the sheriff?

350
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,280
他今天没来上班
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He missed his shift today.

351
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,780
没有  没看见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. No, I haven't.

352
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,460
不过他总会出现的  一向如此
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But he'll turn up. He always does.

353
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,600
你很了解他吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know him pretty well, huh?

354
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,250
我对你也是这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I could say the same about you.

355
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,940
-是吗  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Could you? - Mm.

356
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,180
恐怕不是吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not so sure.

357
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,260
有一些人  在你了解他之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Some people, you can know them

358
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,580
就清楚他的为人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}before you know about them.

359
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,460
或许吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe.

360
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,730
如果喝着啤酒听这些  可能觉得更深奥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or maybe that'd sound a lot more profound if I had had a few beers.

361
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,720
是  我也觉得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I don't doubt that.

362
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,410
好了  有消息告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, well, if you hear from him...

363
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,650
一定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Will do.

364
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,050
现在不说就没机会了  神秘先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now or never, mystery man.

365
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,300
-杰森·胡德在哪  -他死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Where is Jason Hood? - He's dead!

366
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,170
他妈的他死了  我说过了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's fucking dead. I told you.

367
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,820
我为什么要信你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And why should I believe you?

368
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,280
因为是我杀的  满意吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'Cause I killed him, all right?

369
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,950
给你30秒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}30 seconds.

370
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,680
要是哪一个字我不信  你就等着被碾死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I doubt a word, you become roadkill.

371
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,310
他给我5万
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The kid offered me 50 grand

372
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,970
让我杀了你派来的拉风男
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to take out your man in the fancy suit, all right?

373
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,220
先付了2万5  事成之后再付剩下的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}25 up front, 25 when it was done.

374
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,000
你杀了昆汀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You killed Quentin?

375
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,170
是费了点力气
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it took some doing...

376
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,150
确实是我杀的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but, yeah.

377
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,420
继续说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go on.

378
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,930
在我杀了昆汀之后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So after I killed Quentin,

379
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,080
杰森  他不想付剩下的钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jason, he didn't want to pay up

380
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,330
所以威胁要揭发我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and he threatened to expose me.

381
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,470
那你为了拿钱把他杀了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you killed him and took the money?

382
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,750
做事拿钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fair is fair.

383
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,800
我的钱现在在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where is my money now?

384
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,370
在女妖镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's back in Banshee.

385
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,150
-所有的  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- All of it? - Yes.

386
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,550
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}杰森·胡德

387
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,490
总共加起来到底有多少钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And exactly how much is all of it?

388
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,840
布兰特利  他喜欢低调的处理这种事情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brantley, he likes to deal with this sort of thing up close and personal.

389
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,320
6万2千
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}62,000.

390
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,880
我会送你回家的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will take you back home.

391
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,220
你带我去看杰森·胡德的尸体
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You will show me Jason Hood's body.

392
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,430
把我的钱还给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You will return my money.

393
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,330
你刚才为什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's going to stop you from

394
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,730
没一枪崩了我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}shooting me the moment I do?

395
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,130
因为你不在名单上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not on the list.

396
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,650
看样子在我拿回钱之后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Seems I will be taking a trip south of the border

397
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,850
要去南部边境转转了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}after I retrieve my money.

398
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,850
很遗憾  菲利普斯探员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sadly, Agent Phillips,

399
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,820
我们不能一同前往了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your home is not on the itinerary.

400
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,960
万达  告诉科尔先生到前面靠边停
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wanda, tell Mr. Cole up front to pull over.

401
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,620
我的朋友们会陪同你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My associates will escort you

402
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,550
去你下一个目的地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to your next destination.

403
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,890
我们要去哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where the hell is that?

404
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,710
很安全的  菲利普斯探员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Safe travels, Agent Phillips.

405
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,350
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go.

406
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,240
万达  让科尔带我们回女妖镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wanda, tell Mr. Cole to take us back to Banshee.

407
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,230
他们随后就到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The boys will catch up later.

408
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,720
然后给我调杯喝的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And mix me a drink.

409
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,000
经典布雷顿  多加糖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bulleit Old Fashioned, extra sugar.

410
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,510
马上就来  布兰特利先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right away, Mr. Brantley.

你要回去蹲监狱了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're going back into a cell.

413
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,380

你会被判八到十年牢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're facing eight to ten years.

415
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,160
你这一生完了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Life as you know it is over.

416
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,010
站住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey!

417
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,360
别挡道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get out of the way!

418
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,220
趴下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay down.

419

-回来  -趴下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Get back! - Down.

420
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,090
去看看后面的房间  确保没人出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Check the back rooms. Make sure everyone's out.

421
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,380
雷文  我是布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Raven, hey, it's Brock.

422
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,230
听着  萨沃伊脱衣舞俱乐部发生人质劫持
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, I've got a 211 in progress at the Savoy.

423
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,400
目测有五名袭击者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Looks like five assailants

424
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,120
和大概二十四名平民被困在里面  快来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and possibly two dozen civilians trapped inside. Hurry.

425
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,510

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get up.

426

真正的猎犬  昆汀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}True gundog, Quentin.

总能成功让敌人现型
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He could flush out the best of them.

429
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,890
跟我讲讲  你是怎么打败他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me, how'd you beat him?

430
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,440
不  我什么都不会说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I'm not telling you anything.

431
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,580
除非你先告诉我你们为什么为了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not until you tell me why you came so far

432
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,880
杰森·胡德这样的混蛋大老远来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for an asshole like Jason Hood.

433
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,230
像你这样的人肯定不会为了6万块
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, a guy like you doesn't come all the way

434
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,740
横跨整个国家而来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}across the country for 60 grand.

435
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,500
我这种人为了5毛钱都会来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A guy like me would come across the country for 50 cents.

436
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,500
开始挖吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Start digging.

437
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,620
我的身体已经坏了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My body has failed me.

438
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,590
也许是我自找的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I failed it. Either way.

439
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:26,630
结果  简单的事情我都做不来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Things that you take for granted, I can't do.

440
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,590
去杂货店买东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Simple trip to buy groceries

441
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,080
或者去饭店吃饭
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or have a meal at a restaurant.

442
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,950
连女人都上不了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't even fuck anymore.

443
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:38,960
但我有自己的分类账本
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But one thing I do have is my ledger.

444
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,410
我自己记账
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I keep my own books

445
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,840
来保持收支平衡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I keep everything balanced.

446
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,830
一个小数点都不会差
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not a decimal point out of place.

447
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,750
罪恶都在账本的细节里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The devil is in the details.

448
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,840
而这些细节
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the details

449
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,810
是像我这样的人唯一所有的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}are all that a guy like me has.

450
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,040
如果是这样的话  我猜你很想知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In that case, I bet you'd love to know

451
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,590
杰森·胡德最后说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}what Jason Hood's last words were.

452
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,540
告诉我他说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me what he said.

453
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,780
他说要告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He said to tell you...

454
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,870
他很快就会见到你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he'll see your fat ass real fucking soon.

455
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,460
上来  你  给我出来  出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Up here now. You, outta here! Get outta here!

456

快走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Move!

457

458
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,510
待在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay here.

459
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,790
你要干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doing?

460
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,800
不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No!

461
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,510
你自己喝吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have it.

462
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,010
科尔要来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mr. Cole.

463
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:25,970
-万达  猎枪放在哪里了  -柜橱里  底层右面
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Wanda, where are the shotgun shells? - Cabinet, bottom right.

464
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,960
-看别处  不要看我  -不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Look away. Don't look at me. - No.

465
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,490
所有人听着  听着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everyone listen up. Listen up.

466
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,850
我们不是来杀你们的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're not here to kill you.

467
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,730
但完事以后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But when I'm done here... -

468
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,170
你们都要重新换份工作了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}...you're all gonna have to find new jobs.

469
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,320
扔掉你们的武器  把手举起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Drop your weapons! Hands in the air!

470
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,530
不要  你他妈别想了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't! Don't you fucking do it.

471
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,010
都不许动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nobody move.

472
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,420
我说了把你们的武器扔掉  伙计们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I said to drop your weapons, fellas.

473
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:58,940
小子  那把刀要是再靠近她的脖子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Son, that knife gets any closer to her neck,

474
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,530
我就把你的头打爆
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off.

475
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:41,640
万达
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wanda.

476
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,040
警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff's Department!

477
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,820
马上把枪放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put down your guns right now.

478
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,320
汤米  汤米  我是比利·雷文
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tommy! Tommy, it's Billy Raven.

479
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,840
你和你手下马上投降
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You and your boys need to surrender now

480
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,210
不会再有人受伤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and no one else gets hurt.

481
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,270
除了你以外  条子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one except for you, cop.

482
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,990
妈的  汤米  你要听我的话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn it, Tommy! You need to listen to me.

483
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,280
不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No!

484
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,650
阿尔玛  萨沃伊这里需要经济医疗救护
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alma, we need EMTs at the Savoy now.

485
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,150
我去查看后面的房间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll clear the back rooms.

486
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,300
-别乱动  -去死吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Stay still. - Fuck you!

487
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,270
别他妈乱动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, thanks. Don't fucking move.

488
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,790
-雷文  你那边没事吧  -没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Raven, you okay over there? - Yeah.

489
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,120
刀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Knife!

490
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,630
胡德死哪去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where the fuck is Hood?

491
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:10,890
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}69公里

492
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:32,060
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}西
69英里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}513

493
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,410
够深了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's deep enough.

494
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,720
转身
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Turn around.

495
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:58,820
你不想这样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't want to do this.

496
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,450
杀联邦探员会给你找大麻烦的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Killing a federal agent will get you the needle.

497
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,370
再见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good-bye.

498
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,030
我没有杀拉辛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I didn't kill Racine.

499
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,710
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know.

500
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,850
那你他妈的来这干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So what the fuck are you doing here?

501
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,980
因为好奇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was curious.

502
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,530
我被派寻找失踪探员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was tasked to find a missing agent.

503
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,100
你跟这事无关
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not part of that story.

504
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,960
调查局对你一无所知
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The Bureau doesn't know anything about you.

505
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:12,410
那我干嘛不把你埋这儿呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So what's stopping me from leaving you in this hole?

506
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,740
自救这门功课你学的太垃圾了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're doing a pretty shitty job of saving yourself.

507
00:52:23,370 --> 00:52:25,410
看来我们俩都得用功了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Seems we both need to work on that.

508
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,540
同意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Agreed.

509
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,900
我们没事了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So we're good?

510
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,230
对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

511
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,380
没事了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're good.

512
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,400
但你应该知道...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you should know...

513
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,900
在我以为你会是那个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had to do something to cover my ass

514
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,740
你不是的人时  我不得不做了些
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when I thought you would turn out to be

515
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,670
自保的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who you weren't.

516
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,980
你干了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What did you do?

517
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,800

00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,390
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry.

520
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,070
我们都不知道你叫什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We don't even know what to call you.

521
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:43,980
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it?

522
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,360
什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

523
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,020
他们的[荷兰语]
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Godverdomme!

525
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:00,350
你的生活  那个生活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your life, that life,

526
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:02,290
结束了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is over.

527
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,910
-我自己干的  -你不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I work alone. - No, you don't.

528
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,320
楼里有人和你一起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You had someone in that building with you.

529
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,540
你们两个在从楼顶下落时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you two weren't performing some remote hack

530
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:41,600
黑掉了市场上一些最先进的保安系统
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}on some of the most advanced security systems on the market

531
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,220
让我查查
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}while rappelling from the roof,

532
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,360
这就有三个人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so by my count, that adds up to three guys

533
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,210
还不算兔子先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}not counting Mr. Rabbit.

534
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,130
什么  你以为我在为什么犯罪首脑工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind

535
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:52,900
他还自称什么兔子先生吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit?

536
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,310
没错  我就是这么认为的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, I do. Yes, I do!

537
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,630
交出兔子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me Rabbit.

538
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,940
把他供出来  我跟你谈个交易
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give him to me and I'll cut you a deal.

539
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:02,400
也许你会被判18个月  但一年就可以出狱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe you get 18 months. You'll be out after a year.

540
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,220
我会给你提供证人保护计划
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would offer you witness protection,

541
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,040
但你不会有身份
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but you don't have an identity,

542
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,330
所以我猜你大概不需要新身份
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so my guess is that you won't need a new one.

543
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,620
你到底是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the hell are you?

544
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,200
在我看来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The way I see it,

545
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:24,560
你知道谈话的另一个方向是进监狱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you know you got jail on the other side of this conversation.

546
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,330
我用你的指纹提取了档案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I used your prints to pull your file.

547
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:28,490
压根没有  我们甚至不知道你叫什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There isn't one. We don't even know what to call you.

548
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:32,290
你是个幽灵  你所知道生活已经结束了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're a ghost. Life as you know it is over.

549
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:35,990
之后的很多年  你都回不了家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You aren't going home for many years.

550
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,480
你会被关回监狱  而明天的这个时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're going back into a cell and tomorrow at this time,

551
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,480
你会在莱克斯等审判
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you'll be in Rikers awaiting trial.

552
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,810
快点吧  这案子不断牵扯到兔子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, this case has Rabbit written all over it.

553
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,050
什么  你以为我在为什么犯罪首脑工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind

554
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,850
他还自称什么兔子先生吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit?

555
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,210
交出兔子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me Rabbit.

556
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,590
把他供出来  我跟你谈个交易
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give him to me and I'll cut you a deal.

557
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:56,490
好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

558
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,190
为了记录在案  说出你的名字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is for the record. State your name.

559
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,280
约翰·史密斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}John Smith.

560
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,200
你在干嘛  耍我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doing? Are you fucking with me?

561
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,600
没有  是你在耍我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, you're fucking with me.

562
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,340
交易是真的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The deal is real.

563
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,080
你说你想接受交易  你这个傻逼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You said you wanted to take the deal, you stupid motherfucker.

564
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,510
也许  但我不会坐在这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe, but I'm not gonna sit here

565
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,320
替你干活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and do your fuckin' job for you.

566
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,140
这是你的葬礼  混球
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's your funeral, asshole.
