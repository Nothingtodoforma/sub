00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,340
求你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please.

2
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,730
不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

4
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,390
加油  查理  揍他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go, Charlie! Hit him!

5
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,640
狠揍他  哥们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kick his ass, man!

6
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,130
-小心  -我看不下去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Watch your back! - I can't watch this.

7
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,330
-漂亮  -蒂法  我要回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah! - Deva, I'm gonna go home.

8
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,070
蒂法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deva.

9
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,040
比蒂  你想怎么样随便  我不走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Beaty, do whatever the hell you want. I'm staying.

10
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,030
行  我走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine. I'm out of here.

11
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,070
-打啊  -真是好样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Do it! - Hey, that's my boy right there!

12
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,130
去他妈的  我们动真格的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck this shit! Let's get real.

13
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,540
第二轮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Round two!

14
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,170
给他点颜色瞧瞧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh! Light him up!

15
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,060
漂亮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh-ho! That's it!

16
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,030
再来一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah! Again!

17
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,240
你他妈来干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck are you doing here?

18
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,640
我认识个线人  能帮忙找到切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know a CI that can help find Chayton.

19
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,690
是以前红骨帮的  价格会很高
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A former Redbone. Price tag's gonna be steep.

20
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,410
不管多钱  我都给
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whatever it costs, I'll get the money.

21
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,780
通知你的线人吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Call your informant.

22
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,970
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood.

23
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,440
当时有机会  我本应该开枪的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Should have pulled the trigger when I had a chance.

24
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,090
当时旧情一时难舍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's hard to shake all that history in one moment.

25
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,580
相信我  我懂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Trust me, I know.

26
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,580
道格拉斯·斯托上...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Colonel Douglas Sto--

27
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,640
我操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Motherfuck!

28
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,510
直接用斯托的录音不就行了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wouldn't it be easier to just use a recording of Stowe's voice?

29
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,060
不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, it would not.

30
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,770
斯托的语音识别系统
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stowe's voice recognition system

31
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,710
能识别大部分数字模拟声音
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}can identify most digital forgeries.

32
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,690
道格拉斯·斯托上校
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Colonel Douglas Stowe.

33
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,280
但无法识别我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But not mine.

34
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,890
行了  我们可以动手了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right. Then we good to go.

35
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,370
还差得远呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We ain't even close.

36
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,350
那个基地跟前三次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That base looks the same as it did

37
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,120
你看的时候  一模一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the last three times you checked it.

38
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,500
不  就是不对劲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, something ain't right.

39
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,850
可能是你哪根筋搭错了吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That would be your nerves.

40
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,970
别闹  我的筋都是焊接好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please, I do not do nerves.

41
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,480
你想知道我在想什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you want to know what I think?

42
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,230
你知道我对那个问题的答案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You do know my answer to that question

43
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,550
永远不会变  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}never changes, right?

44
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,650
打消疑虑方法只有一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's only one way to lay those doubts to rest.

45
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,460
而且不是在这里傻坐着把自己逼疯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And it ain't sitting around here driving yourself crazy.

46
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,680
仅此而已
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's all.

47
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,200
别叫  不然杀了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Scream and I'll kill you.

48
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,650
这里还有别人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there anyone else in the house?

49
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,730
我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go.

50
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,200
我要向山举目
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills

51
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,410
我的帮助从何而来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}from whence cometh my help.

52
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,080
我的帮助从造天地的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My help cometh from the Lord

53
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,400
耶和华而来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}which made heaven and earth.

54
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,550
他必不叫你的脚摇动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He will not suffer thy foot to be moved.

55
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,150
保护你的必不打盹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He will keepeth thee and will not slumber.

56
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,380
保护以色列的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Behold, He that keepeth Israel

57
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,040
也不打盹  也不睡觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}shall neither slumber nor sleep.

58
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,430
兄弟们  如果有基督徒偶尔不慎犯了罪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression,

59
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,260
你们灵命坚强的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you who are spiritual should restore him

60
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,680
就应该温和耐心地纠正他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in a spirit of gentleness.

61
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,630
欢迎  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Welcome, Kai.

62
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,570
同时也要提高警觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Keep watch on yourself lest you,

63
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,540
免受诱惑  远离犯罪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}too, be tempted.

64
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,990
如果有人自以为是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If anyone thinks they are something when they are not,

65
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,100
他们就是自欺欺人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}they deceive themselves.

66
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,360
人人需要醒己之行为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Each one should test their own actions.

67
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,040
之后便可对己引以为傲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then they can take pride in themselves alone

68
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,490
不拿自己与他人作比
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}without comparing themselves to someone else.

69
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,080
每个人都要负起自己的责任
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For each should carry their own load.

70
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,620
那人身高约一米九三  满身部落刺青
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, the man is 6'4" and covered in tribal tats.

71
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,250
我不信没人看到过他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't believe no one has seen him.

72
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,750
不  我理解
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I-- I understand.

73
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,830
好  如果有任何消息  请马上通知我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, but, look, if you hear anything, you know where to find me.

74
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,250
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you.

75
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,880
有出警吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Any calls?

76
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,670
没有  漫长的一天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, sir. Slow day.

77
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,940
你好  我是艾米丽·洛特斯  有事请留言
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi, you've reached Emily Lotus. Please leave a message.

78
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,510
你好  是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, hi. It's me.

79
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,080
又是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Again.

80
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,460
好久没你的消息了  所以...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Haven't heard from you, so...

81
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,640
我知道你现在不太想见到我  但是...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, I know I'm not your most favorite person right now, but...

82
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,720
我刚刚还在想我们的事然后  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you know, I was just thinking about us and I-- thanks.

83
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,400
请尽快回我电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, yeah, please return my call at your earliest convenience.

84
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,370
费城来的朋友告诉我  你对之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our friend from Philadelphia tells me you're a little confused

85
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,050
弗拉奇尔先生叫他转达的提议不太明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}about the offer he delivered from Mr. Frazier.

86
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,550
他们从我们的竞争对手那里买货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They were buying from our competition

87
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,080
而你要用降价来奖励他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you want to reward that with a discount?

88
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,190
我已经同意了弗拉奇尔的条件
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I already agreed to Frazier's terms.

89
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,470
立刻终止所有与萨尔瓦多人的交易
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stop all sales to the Salvadorans immediately.

90
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,750
懂了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that understood?

91
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,310
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}讲讲理吧

92
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,550
懂了吗  丽贝卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that understood, Rebecca?

93
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,940
你叔叔知道你来这里了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Does your uncle know you're here?

94
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,410
不关你的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's not your concern.

95
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,070
没有什么不关我的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything is my concern.

96
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
你说  我为什么要跟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So tell me, why am I having a conversation

97
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,970
断了我货的家伙的侄女谈话呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with the niece of the man who cut me off?

98
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,850
我来修正那个暂时的错误
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm here to correct that temporary error in judgment.

99
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,040
你凭什么认为我会从你手上买货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What makes you think I'd ever buy from you?

100
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,720
因为你不买就太傻了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because you'd be a fool not to.

101
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,960
据说弗拉奇尔正在试图
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Word on the street is that Frazier

102
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,760
让你歇业
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is trying to put you out of business.

103
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,360
你管不住你的地盘
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've lost control of your street corners,

104
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,150
和你的人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your raves.

105
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,170
几周之内  你就会彻底关门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In a couple of weeks, you'll be shut down completely.

106
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,330
而我能让你重返赛场
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can get you back in the game.

107
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,800
你能
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can you?

108
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,590
我们开始时慢一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll start slow.

109
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,450
每周两公斤  每公斤七千块
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Two kilos per week at 7,000 per.

110
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,090
每公斤四千
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}4,000 per key.

111
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,250
六千
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}6,000.

112
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,430
要么你也可以去求弗拉奇尔赏你块骨头
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or maybe you can convince Frazier to throw you a bone.

113
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,590
你们交情不浅  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You guys go way back, don't you?

114
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,200
我喜欢你  小妞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I like you, chica.

115
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,910
真心的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I really do.

116
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,040
但要是你敢耍我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if you fuck me,

117
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,860
你叔叔就只能见到你的残片了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your uncle will be scooping you up in tiny little pieces.

118
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,880
我很期待与您达成长期而富有成效的合作  莫拉莱斯先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I look forward to a long and fruitful relationship, Mr. Morales.

119
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,750
叫我赫克托
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hector.

120
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,680
顺便说一声  我一直在注意联调局的动静
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just so you know, I have been monitoring the FBI's progress.

121
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,030
谢顿还是没有音讯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton is still off the grid.

122
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,610
可胡德警官  就不同了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff Hood, however, is not.

123
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,260
费列罗队长起草了一份正式的意见书
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Captain Ferillo has filed a formal complaint.

124
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,260
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}Captain Ferillo 警匪美剧《希尔街的布鲁斯》中的角色

125
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,270
你一直盯着热那亚营呢吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Have you been watching Camp Genoa?

126
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,380
你听见我刚才的话了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you hear what I just said?

127
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,190
听见了  去他的费列罗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I did. Fuck Ferillo.

128
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,320
有什么需要我小心的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there anything I should worry about?

129
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,470
恕我直言  我们都应当谨慎一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}With all due respect, we should all be a little worried.

130
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,180
我想把活推迟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want to delay the job.

131
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,880
基地这周末就关了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That base will be shut down by the end of the week.

132
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,400
现在不做就没机会了  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's now or never, Job.

133
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,760
那恐怕就没机会了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then I guess it's never.

134
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,310
什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

135
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,880
亲  怎样的你我都见过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Baby, I have seen every side of you there is.

136
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,750
鲁莽的  二缺的  特别是固执的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Reckless, dumb, and especially stubborn.

137
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,910
但我从没见你这样过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I ain't never seen this.

138
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,940
你陷得太深了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You in the deep end.

139
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,030
要是你还不能让自己脱离困境
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you don't keep your head above water,

140
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,620
你会拉着我们一起沉没的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you going to drag the rest of us down there with you.

141
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,080
我们要干这个活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're doing the fucking job.

142
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,040
今晚就干
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're doing it tonight.

143
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,960
那祝你们好运
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, good luck with that.

144
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,120
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job.

145
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,380
你曾问我需要什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You asked me what I needed.

146
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,360
现在  就这事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right now, this is it.

147
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,930
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine.

148
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,110
我去洗漱一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll go get cleaned up.

149
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,860
拍嫌犯照片的时候希望能好看点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Might as well look pretty for my mug shot.

150
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,700
按住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold.

151
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,330
好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

152
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,090
你不怕我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not afraid of me?

153
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,260
不怕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

154
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,270
你应该怕我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should be.

155
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,430
我把丈夫和孩子都埋葬了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I buried a husband and a child.

156
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,170
甚至曾觉得没有生存下去的意义
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There are days I don't think I have anything left to live for anyway.

157
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,910
她又赢不了选美比赛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, she ain't gonna win no beauty contests.

158
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,240
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you.

159
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,630
他怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So how is he?

160
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,670
和以前一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Same as ever.

161
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,610
别担心  他还是很可靠的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, don't worry, we can count on him.

162
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,680
女服务员到了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Has the waitress checked in?

163
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,490
卡莉还没报道  但她会来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Carrie hasn't checked in yet, but she will.

164
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,530
她最好有好状态
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She best be on her game.

165
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,330
瞧瞧那两个人  你说不准还以为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'd think we were knocking over a motherfucking 7-Eleven

166
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,700
咱们是去抢便利店呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the way these two are acting.

167
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,020
你知道吗  贾伯  你操太多心了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what, Job? You worry too much.

168
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,900
总得有个人来操心吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, somebody's got to.

169
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,660
咱们来看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's see what we got.

170
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,300
很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's good.

171
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,150
比蒂  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Beaty. What's up?

172
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,760
什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

173
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,480
她在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where is she?

174
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,570
-你确定是这里吗  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You sure this is the place? - Yes.

175
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,640
我能让你待在车里别过来吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Any chance I can convince you to stay out here?

176
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,520
那好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, then.

177
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,010
蒂法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deva!

178
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,670
-搞什么  -马上跟我们回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What the fuck? - We're going home now.

179
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,190
你们在这干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell are you guys doing here?

180
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,880
-别让我说第二遍  -她哪都不去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm not gonna tell you again. - She's not going anywhere.

181
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,100
-你还是闭嘴吧  -我才不信呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Okay, you need to shut your mouth. - I don't believe this.

182
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,810
你们不能突然就决定管我了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You guys can't just decide when to give a shit.

183
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,520
-蒂法  -不  我要留下来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Deva! - No, I'm staying.

184
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,100
你也听到了  她哪都不去  伙计
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You heard her, she's not going anywhere, man.

185
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,110
给我让开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get out of my way.

186
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,900
这可是我的地盘  老家伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're on my property, old man.

187
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,060
你还是赶紧滚吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you need to fuck off now.

188
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,060
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

189
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,640
深呼吸  咱们好好考虑考虑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's just all take a deep breath and think about this.

190
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,990
你会后悔的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You shouldn't have done that.

191
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,410
-戈登  -查理  求你不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Gordon! - Charlie, no! Please!

192
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,620
-求你别  -蒂法  你他妈闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Please, don't. - Deva, shut the fuck up!

193
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,920
你有胆量开枪吗  小子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You man enough to pull that trigger, son?

194
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,090
我要杀了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll kill you.

195
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,290
爸爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dad.

196
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,280
那就少废话开枪吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then stop talking and do it.

197
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,080
我发誓我会开枪  狗娘养的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I swear, I'll shoot you, motherfucker.

198
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,770
开枪啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Pull it.

199
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,880
把枪放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put the gun down.

200
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,640
蒂法  过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deva, come here!

201
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,110
我操  是市长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Holy fuck. That's the mayor.

202
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,620
你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You okay?

203
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,690
我不怎么在外面吃饭
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't eat out much.

204
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,300
老实说  我自己也很久没出来吃饭了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To be honest, it's been a while for me, too.

205
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,370
我都忘了高跟鞋有多折磨人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Forgotten what medieval torture high heels can be.

206
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,080
你美极了  艾米丽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You look beautiful, Emily.

207
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,540
我也好久没听过这种话了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's also been some time since I've heard that.

208
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,690
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you.

209
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,310
敬我们都走出了舒适区
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, here is to getting outside of our comfort zones.

210
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,070
你的笑容很美
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have a nice smile.

211
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,290
我觉得很少有人能看到你舒展笑颜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I bet not many people get to see that.

212
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,310
没错  我觉得不多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. No, I guess not.

213
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,800
我知道把自己隔绝起来是什么感受
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I know what it's like to put up walls.

214
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,030
你的侄女  瑞贝卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your niece, Rebecca--

215
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,290
她跟你一起住多久了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}how long has she been living with you?

216
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,060
不久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not long.

217
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,150
她惹上了些麻烦  需要有人指点迷津
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She was in trouble. She needed guidance.

218
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,780
她现在应该靠她自己了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the time is coming for her to be on her own.

219
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,250
可能这样最好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's probably for the best.

220
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,960
你觉得其他家长也是这么管孩子的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So do you think that's what other family interventions are like?

221
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,680
希望吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hope so.

222
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,350
凭什么乐子都让咱们俩享受了呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, why should we be the only ones having all the fun?

223
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,820
你想要来一点还是来一大杯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You want a small pour or big?

224
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,370
我不喝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Neither.

225
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,920
我们做得很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We did good out there.

226
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,220
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, we did.

227
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,930
你去哪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where were you?

228
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,020
去兜了兜风  希望你别介意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I went for a little ride. Hope you don't mind.

229
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,900
如果你在测试我的耐心  那就太不明智了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It would be unwise to test me.

230
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,130
做梦都不敢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wouldn't dream of it.

231
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,700
你的车没油了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're out of gas.

232
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,260
那...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So...

233
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,060
回见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See you around?

234
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:24,790
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

235
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,750
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

236
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,470
晚安  戈登
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good night, Gordon.

237
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,850
晚安
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good night.

238
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,180
你可以开走我丈夫的卡车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can take my husband's truck.
