1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,520
我们天上的主
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our Father, who art in heaven,

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,650
愿人都尊你的名为圣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}hallowed be Thy name.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,060

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done

00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,610

宽恕我们的罪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and forgive us our trespasses,

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,410
如我们宽恕别人一般
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}as we forgive those who trespass against us,

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,320
指引我们避开诱惑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and lead us not into temptation,

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,790
带领我们远离罪恶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but deliver us from evil.

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,880
阿门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Amen.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,020
{\an8}欢迎来到女妖镇
镇界 请注意交通安全

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,670
看来你今天过的很糟  来杯威士忌吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna go with shitty day and whiskey neat.

13
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,980
你是进镇还是离镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You coming or going?

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,020
我还没想好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm still working that out.

15
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,430
这儿一直都这么安静吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is it always this quiet around here?

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,380
来刺激一下当地经济
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's stimulate the local economy.

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,380
-下一轮酒算我的  -好啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Next round's on me. - All right.

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,040
你们这些游客今天老给我买酒喝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All you tourists buying me drinks today.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,510
我不是来旅游的  我叫卢卡斯·胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, I'm not a tourist. My name's Lucas Hood.

20
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,620
下周一就宣誓就职  就任新警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come Monday, I'm being sworn in as the new sheriff.

21
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,050
恭喜你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Congratulations.

22
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,660
你的头儿知道你在这吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your boss know you're here?

23
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,680
不用你操心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't you worry about him.

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,890
你知道规矩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know the drill.

25
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,200
看看这家伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look at this guy.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,550
不好意思  我们打扰到你了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Excuse me. Are we disturbing you?

27
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,150
完全没有  这牛排很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, not at all. This is just a very good steak.

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,340
我知道自己一站起来对付你们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I know once I stand up to deal with you fellas,

29
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,500
你们要么会投降  要么会被我宰了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}well, maybe you'll come quietly or maybe I'll have to kill you.

30
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,470
但不管怎样  牛排会冷掉的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But either way, this steak is gonna get cold.

31
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,310
虽然可以再热  味道却不一样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you can always reheat a steak, but it's never quite the same.

32
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,980
你胆子真不小  狗娘养的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have some balls on you, motherfucker.

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,400
我是警察  放下枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff's Department. I'll take that gun now.

34
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,520
你把枪放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You drop your fucking gun.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,950
你们都把枪放下吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you all put your fucking guns down?

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,210
现在的局面对谁都不利
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See, what we have here is a lose-lose situation.

37
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,820
但是还有别的选择
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's still options on the table.

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,960
你们可以放聪明点  拿上点钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You boys could be smart, take a wad of cash,

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,370
再带瓶波本酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a bottle of bourbon,

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,170
回家坐沙发上大喝一顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}go home, sit on the porch, get drunk.

41
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,130
安然度过今天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Call it a good day.

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,420
你们也可以犯傻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or you can be stupid.

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,670
跟我们这位警长动枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Try and shoot it out with the sheriff here.

44
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,990
即便是最好的情况  你们也得死一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Best-case scenario, one of you boys is dead.

45
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,900
想想吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Think about that.

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,560
我看你也不傻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Seems like a no-brainer to me.

47
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,180
但我看人也不一定准
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But then, what the fuck do I know?

48
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,920
拿钱走人  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take the money, assholes.

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,670
我们拿着钱和酒走人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll take the cash and the bourbon.

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,880
警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff?

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,520
谢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks.

52
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,060
我该请你们再喝一轮了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That deserves another round on me.

53
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,210
抱歉钱被他们拿走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry about your cash.

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,570
没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't mention it.

55
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,590
谢谢你救了我一命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks for saving my ass.

56
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,100
不客气
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No problem.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,500
他好像有急事要处理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He seemed to be in an awful hurry.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe I can get my nose pierced somewhere.

60
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,660
想得美
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't even think about it.

61
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,920
比蒂她妈妈就同意了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Beaty's mom said she could get her nose pierced.

62
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,650

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Couldn't get out of the car,

65
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,700
我不怪你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't blame you.

66
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:31,350
我知道现在一切都很混乱  但是...

明白吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You hear me?

69
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,470
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood?

70

是咱俩找到那个混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is for the two of us to go find that fucker

吗啡影响了她的语言能力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The morphine was affecting her speech,

但我知道  她弥留之际
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I do know that in her final moments

113

没事  找我什么事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I'm fine. What can I do for you?

121
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,330
我刚刚跟普罗科特的新律师聊了聊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just went a few rounds with Proctor's new lawyer.

00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,970
胡德这事  估计会很麻烦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This situation with Hood is gonna be messy.

123
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,290
普罗科特拒捕  还袭警
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Proctor resisted arrest and assaulted the sheriff.

124
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,750
这事我看毫无争议
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Seems pretty cut and dry to me.

125
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,130
如果这是事实的话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If that's what really happened.

126
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,200
-这就是事实  -很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah, that's what really happened. - Good.

127
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,100
你信就好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Glad you believe that

128
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,450
反正出庭作证的是你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}since you'll be the one testifying at the trial.

129
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,930
-为什么是我  -你是负责逮捕的警官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Why me? - You're the arresting officer.

130
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,620
胡德是受害者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood was a victim.

131
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,570
我的证人可不是这么说的  布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've got witnesses that say otherwise, Brock.

132
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,160
这事不会毫无争议  情况很复杂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's not cut and dry, it's complicated.

133
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,230
这么说吧  戈登
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what, Gordon?

134
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,640
只要能给凯·普罗科特定罪  让我干嘛都行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will do anything you need to convict Kai Proctor.

135
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,820
听起来像是私人恩怨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sounds personal.

136
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,860
本来就是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It is.

137
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:26,700
介意我来两枪吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You mind?

138
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,470
不介意  你随意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, be my guest.

139
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,940
一定要握紧枪把  因为...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Make sure you get a good, firm grip on that handle 'cause it--

140
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,990
你常射击吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shoot much?

141
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,230
偶尔吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, now and then.

142
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,190
他会没事的  知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's gonna be okay, you know.

143
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,600
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, I know.

144
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,320
他以前也心碎过不少次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ain't like he's never had his heart broke before.

145
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,330
但每次的活儿都不一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But not all jobs are created equal.

146
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,630
这次要是搞砸  我们就死定了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Any fuckups on this one could get us all dead.

147
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,750
所以呢  你要取消吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, what, you want to call it off?

148
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,440
我怎么想不重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't matter what I want.

149
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,370
弄完了我和你说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll let you know when it's done.

150
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,300
你需要什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you need?

151
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,350
我不喝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nothing.

152
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,230
宝贝  从1990年开始
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Baby, I ain't talked you out of doing something

153
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,250
我就没劝过你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}since nineteen-ninety-never,

154
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,390
所以我再问你一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I'm going to ask you again.

155
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,870
你需要什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you need?

156
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,270
警官  我们有情况了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sir, we have a situation.

157
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,290
这个又高又黑的纳粹分子是哪位
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the hell is tall, dark, and Nazi?

158
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,270
怎么了  邦克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it, Bunker?

159
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,590
联邦调查局调了一支战术小队
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The FBI has got a TAC team

160
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,640
部署在凯迪店里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}setting up shop inside the Cadi.

161
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,370
他们发现了切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They found Chayton.

162
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,870
布罗克觉得应该告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brock figured you'd want to know.

163
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,910
我相信你和我一样对此感到"高兴"
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sure you're as happy about this as I am.

164
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,070
谁是负责人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who's in charge?

165
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,190
没有警徽的人请马上离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anybody not wearing a badge clear out now.

166
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,120
你猜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One guess.

167
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,920
胡德  两位能回避下吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood. Can you guys give us a minute?

168
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,910
你是想让我好好配合吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You want me to play nice?

169
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,310
我想要什么并不重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not what I want that matters.

170
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,240
切顿·里特斯通现在由司法部接手了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton Littlestone is the DOJ's problem now.

171
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
指挥权归联邦调查局所有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The feds have operational command.

172
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,810
不要让这件事难上加难了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't make this harder than it needs to be.

173
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,790
弗瑞罗指挥官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Commander Ferillo.

174
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,020
这位是警长胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is Sheriff Hood.

175
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,940
他和他的队伍来了  你可以任意调遣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He and his team are here to support you in any way you see fit.

176
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,830
谢谢  镇长先生  你们来得正是时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You're just in time.

177
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,310
我正要给手下说明情况
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was about to brief my men.

178
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,740
我们的首要任务是等级为一级的威胁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our primary target is a threat level one.

179
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,350
局长已经批准了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Director has authorized

180
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,960
必要时可以使用局长权限的武力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the use of necessary force in his apprehension.

181
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,040
空中侦测在奇诺部落领地内
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Eye in the sky has detected

182
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,770
发现了一个地处偏僻的红骨帮营地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a remote Redbone encampment deep in Kinaho territory.

183
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,900
这片地区被密集的树林覆盖  交通不便
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The area is heavily wooded with limited vehicle access

184
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,900
{\an8}营地位置

185
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,420
夜间可视性也有限
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and limited nighttime visibility.

186
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,970
重案反应小组会驻扎在这条临近的通路上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}CIRG will stage on this adjacent access road.

187
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,170
我们步行靠近
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll approach on foot.

188
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,220
破晓时分我们就执行逮捕行动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll execute the arrest warrant at first light.

189
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,130
-有问题吗  -有  我们呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Any questions? - Yeah, what about us?

190
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,880
本地执法人员和奇诺警局的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Local law enforcement and members of Kinaho PD

191
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,550
将对这次行动进行观察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}will observe the operation.

192
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,290
观察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Observe?

193
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,830
警长  我知道这个人杀了你们的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff, I know this guy killed one of your own

194
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,600
对此我深感同情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I am sympathetic to that.

195
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,390
所以才邀请你们同行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why you're being invited along.

196
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,370
但是请你清楚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But make no mistake;

197
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,090
这个案子已在联邦管辖范围内
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}this matter falls under federal jurisdiction.

198
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,700
所以就当帮大家个忙  别参与进来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, please, do us all a favor and stay out of the way.

199
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,520
当然了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sure thing.

200
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,460
你能把这张桌子布置一下吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can you get this table set up?

201
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,620
能不能把这堆破烂拿出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can somebody get this shit out of here?

202
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,540
两个小时后就开门  动作快点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We open up in two hours. Come on.

203
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,380
把这些钢管擦得亮些
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put some polish on those poles.

204
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,410
一定要闪亮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want them to shine.

205
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,980
她可以擦擦我的"管子"
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She can polish my pole.

206
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,120
有什么问题吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there a problem over here?

207
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,310
没有  女士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, ma'am.

208
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,760
后边有两箱伏特加
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There are two cases of vodka out back.

209
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,690
-把它们搬到吧台来  -我是可以搬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Bring them to the bar. - You know, I would,

210
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,310
但我不是为你工作的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I don't work for you.

211
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,780
我是为普罗科特工作的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I work for Mr. Proctor.

212
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,430
你不用给任何人工作了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now you don't work for anybody.

213
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,680
-收拾东西滚吧  -去你妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Pack your shit and go. - Suck my dick.

214
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,600
送这位先生出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please escort this man off the property.

215
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,240
他不该到这里来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's trespassing.

216
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,020
你要送我离开了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're gonna escort me now.

217
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,590
遵命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, ma'am.

218
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,930
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go.

219
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,790
好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

220
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,350
自不量力  贱人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're out of your league, cunt.

221
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,280
把他带走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get him out of here.

222
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,000
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it?

223
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,650
有三个费城来的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There are three men here

224
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,960
要见普罗科特先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}from Philadelphia asking to see Mr. Proctor.

225
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,650
弗拉奇尔的人吗  让他们进来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Frazier's men? Show them in.

226
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,100
先生们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gentlemen.

227
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,310
你就是雷诺克斯吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You must be Lennox.

228
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,060
我从我叔叔凯那里听了你不少事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've heard good things from my Uncle Kai.

229
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
请坐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please, have a seat.

230
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,880
-普罗科特先生呢  -他有别的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Where is Mr. Proctor? - Tending to other business.

231
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,810
我会代表他处理事务
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll be speaking on his behalf.

232
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,810
我们一般只和你老板谈事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're accustomed to dealing direct with your boss.

233
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,220
我们一般也只和你老板谈事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And we're accustomed to dealing directly with your boss,

234
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
也就是弗拉奇尔先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mr. Frazier.

235
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,650
鉴于你大老远从费城跑来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But seeing as you drove all the way from Philadelphia,

236
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,170
我这回破个例
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm willing to make an exception.

237
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,240
你说呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How about you?

238
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,180
考虑到最近的事  弗拉奇尔先生想要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In light of recent events, Mr. Frazier would like

239
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,290
重新和普罗科特先生建立生意关系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to reestablish his business dealings with Mr. Proctor.

240
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,200
凯奇家族不干了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is the Cage family no longer making deliveries?

241
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,250
为了得到适当的减价
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're prepared to double our previous order

242
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,290
我们准备把订单数量翻倍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in exchange for a modest price reduction.

243
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,520
你想要折扣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You want a discount?

244
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,500
还要普罗科特先生能以个人名义保证
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}As well as Mr. Proctor's personal assurance

245
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,140
他不再向萨尔瓦多人供货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that he will stop selling to the Salvadorans

246
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,210
协议立刻起效
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}effective immediately.

247
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,450
普罗科特先生可以继续向弗拉奇尔供货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mr. Proctor will start selling to Frazier again,

248
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,700
但我们的价格只涨不减
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but our prices have gone up, not down,

249
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,320
考虑到最近发生的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in light of recent events.

250
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,330
涨10%的价
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A 10% increase.

251
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,150
至于萨尔瓦多人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And as for the Salvadorans,

252
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,200
回去告诉你老板
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}tell your boss

253
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,270
凯·普罗科特想给谁供货都行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that Kai Proctor sells to whoever he wants.

254
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,310
谢谢你的接待  保持联系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you for your time. We'll be in touch.

255
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,270
我父亲信奉的神易怒且有报复心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My father believed in an angry and vengeful God,

256
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,100
他会惩罚不忠者  给予他们痛苦和折磨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}one who punished transgression with pain and suffering.

257
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,340
我小的时候  父亲让我恐惧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}As a child, he taught me to cower in fear.

258
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,720
但随着年纪渐长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the older I got,

259
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,770
他的固执越来越让我愤怒  所以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the more his dogma angered me, so...

260
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,170
我在背上纹了这个十字来挑战他信奉的神
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I put that cross on my back as a challenge to his God.

261
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,860
看看我是不是会遭到他所说的报应
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To finally see if I'd be dealt with the way he said I would.

262
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,050
-那你遭到报应了吗  -没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- And were you? - No.

263
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,060
至少我觉得没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At least I didn't think so.

264
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,510
但最近我在想  这种惩罚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But lately I've begun to wonder if the punishment

265
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,750
可能更微妙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}was something more subtle,

266
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:17,270
更不易察觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}less obvious.

267
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,040
你很孤独
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're alone.

268
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,090
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

269
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,640
你不必这么孤独  我们都不用
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't have to be. Neither of us does.

270
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,150
我身上有些事你不会喜欢的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'll learn things about me that you won't like.

271
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,640
我一直住在这里  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've lived in this town my whole life, Kai.

272
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,980
我知道你是什么人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know who you are.

273
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,450
昨天我们是一种人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We were all someone else yesterday.

274
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,350
明天又会是另一种人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll be someone else tomorrow.

275
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,750
你来啦  真是个大惊喜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi. This is a nice surprise.

276
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,540
先别这么想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold that thought.

277
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,650
米勒老师需要家长签字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Miss Miller wants that signed by a parent.

278
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,300
我刚好在附近  想着你还算是家长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was in the neighborhood and figured you might still qualify.

279
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,930
最近三次作业你都没交
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You didn't hand in your last three assignments.

280
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,580
又或者  我只是漏交了三次作业
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or some might say I'm only three assignments behind.

281
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,530
考虑到我家的情况
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Which, given my home circumstances,

282
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,740
我能做到这份上已经很不容易了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is a pretty significant accomplishment,

283
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,470
不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}don't you think?

284
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,120
蒂法  你知道我们有什么共同点吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deva, you know what you and I have in common?

285
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,250
我们都被骗了16年
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We were both lied to for 16 years?

286
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,080
这是其中一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, that's one way to look at it.

287
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,420
但还有一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But there's also this.

288
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,430
我们仍是我们自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're the people that we always said we were.

289
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,170
我仍然是你父亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm still your father.

290
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,000
不会变的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That'll never change.

291
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,970
明白吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay?

292
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,390
走吧  我开车送你回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, I'll drive you home.

293
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,870
不用了  我走回去就好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, it's okay. I'll walk.

294
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,950
谢谢  爸爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks, Dad.

295
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,540
-这么准时  -你知道我的  很规律的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Right on time. - You know me. I'm a creature of habit.

296
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,780
陪我坐坐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sit with me.

297
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,430
-我不能  -拜托  店里又没人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I can't. - Come on, the place is empty.

298
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,270
就五分钟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Five minutes.

299
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,830
我很怀念和你在一起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I miss what we had.

300
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,710
我知道你也很怀念
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I know you miss it, too.

301
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,870
我有说错吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Am I wrong?

302
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,970
没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

303
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,050
那今晚在老地方见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then meet me at the motel tonight.

304
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,000
我受宠若惊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm flattered.

305
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,150
但我说过要结束一切  我是认真的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But when I said we were through, I meant it.

306
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,910
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

307
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,260
看来我要继续努力了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I guess I just had to take another run at it.

308
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,790
相信我  我懂的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Believe me, I get it.

309
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,760
-还点往常的吗  -今天算了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- The usual? - Not today.

310
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,100
我刚没了胃口
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I just lost my appetite.

311
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,050
谢谢咖啡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks for the coffee.

312
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,530
天哪  很抱歉  你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

313
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,950
只是有点尴尬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, just a little embarrassed.

314
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,960
那完全是我的错  我应该更小心些的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That was totally my fault. I should be more careful.

315
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,720
我真是笨手笨脚的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God. I'm a total spaz.

316
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,210
不  不  不是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, no, you're okay.

317
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,950
-祝你愉快  -你也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Have a great day. - Yeah, you, too.

318
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,810
-身手不错  -你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Nice lift. - Excuse me?

319
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,480
那个家伙  他完全不知道被玩了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That guy, he never knew what hit him.

320
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,070
你偷了多少钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How much you score?

321
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,690
我完全不知道你在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have no idea what you're talking about.

322
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,510
你担心我是警察吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, you worried I'm a cop?

323
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,380
不  我认识镇上所有的警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I know all the cops in this town.

324
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,650
我是担心你是变态
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm worried you're a creep.

325
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,860
所以你是本地人啦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you're from around here?

326
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,720
你想干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there a reason you're still talking to me?

327
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,680
可不是每天都能遇见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it's not every day that I meet a beautiful girl

328
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,000
偷窃技术高超的美女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with mad pickpocket skills.

329
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,420
所以只是想知道你还擅长什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So just kind of wondering what else you're good at.

330
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,980
我猜也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I bet you are.

331
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,570
你想去玩玩吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You want to get out of here?

332
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,210
我和朋友们在办一个派对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm throwing a little party with some friends.

333
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,020
绝对有意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Guaranteed good times.

334
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,020
你真觉得我会和一个陌生人去派对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You actually think I'd go to a party with a total stranger?

335
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,720
我是查理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm Charlie.

336
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,460
查理·诺尔斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Charlie Knowles.

337
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,400
说得好像我应该认识你似的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You say that like I should know who you are.

338
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
不  不过我希望你能认识我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, but I'd like you to.

339
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,400
你真神经
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're crazy.

340
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,120
是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

341
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,940
那你愿意来吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Does that mean you're coming?

342
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,670
我能带个朋友吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can I bring a friend?

343
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,350
人越多越热闹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The more the merrier.

344
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,450
声音呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the voice?

345
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,170
不管你听到什么  都别再对我提起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whatever you hear, I don't want to talk about it.

346
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,940
我很怀念和你在一起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I miss what we had.

347
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,060
我知道你也很怀念
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I know you miss it, too.

348
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,110
-我有说错吗  -没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Am I wrong? - No.

349
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,190
真他妈难以置信
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Un-fucking-believable.

350
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,240
靠过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bring it in.

351
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,010
红骨帮营地在正北三英里处  都是山路
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Redbone camp is a three-mile hike due north.

352
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,870
目前情报显示里特斯通在营地里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Current intel shows that Littlestone is in the camp,

353
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,100
所以我们要拿下他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so we are gonna take him down.

354
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,350
日出在六点半
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sunrise is at 0630.

355
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:47,570
我要嫌疑人在六点三十三分缉拿归案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want the suspect in custody by 0633.

356
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,970
正北方三里山路
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Three-mile hike due north.

357
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,760
突破外围  三个火力小组
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Breach the perimeter, three fire teams,

358
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,570
呈标准队形  从这里  这里  还有这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}standard formation, from here, here, and here.

359
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,020
行动迅速  在他们睡觉时袭击
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go in fast, we go in hard while they're sleeping.

360
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,560
要警惕他们反抗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We should still anticipate resistance,

361
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,100
尤其是里特斯通
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}especially from Littlestone himself.

362
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,690
我们的目标是零伤亡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now our objective is zero casualties.

363
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,710
就算有人要受伤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if somebody has to get hit,

364
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,460
那也必须是他们受伤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}damn straight it's gonna be one of them.

365
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,940
好了  各位知道规矩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, you know the drill.

366
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,570
保持警惕  保住性命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay alert, stay alive.

367
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,980
三十分钟后行动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Move out in 30 minutes.

368
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,460
是的  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, sir.

369
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,650
你这样坐视不理没问题吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You okay watching this from the cheap seats?

370
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,330
-你也听到了  这是人家的场子  -弗瑞罗长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You heard the man. It's his show. - Commander Ferillo.

371
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,730
我知道你有任务在身
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know that you have a job to do.

372
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,600
我想确保这只是逮捕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just want to be sure that this is an arrest

373
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,080
不是枪决
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and not an execution.

374
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,210
不好意思  你哪位
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry, who are you?

375
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,010
艾米·金  奇诺警局
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Aimee King, Kinaho Police Department.

376
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,590
金警官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, Officer King,

377
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:35,100
那个警察杀手得跟我走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that cop killer is coming home with me.

378
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,550
要死要活  就看他了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dead or alive, the choice is his.

379
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,620
你再好好考虑站在哪一边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You might want to consider whose side you're on.

380
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,240
-长官  -金  够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Commander-- - King, that's enough.

381
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,440
听起来你在帮那个人渣说话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sounded like you were sticking up for that piece of shit.

382
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,580
你我都知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You and I both know that

383
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,280
切顿没法活着离开这座山
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton isn't leaving this mountain alive.

384
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,050
知道  但我不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, but I don't have a problem with that.

385
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,330
你为什么在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So why do you?

386
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,620
我也认识西沃恩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, I knew Siobhan, too.

387
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,390
他像扭树枝一样扭断了她的脖子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He snapped her neck like a twig.

388
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,980
还很享受
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And he enjoyed it.

389
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,350
这是哪里啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is this place?

390
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,910
本来是我父母的房子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was my parents' house.

391
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,970
他们死后就成了我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then after they died, it became mine.

392
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,540
-不错  -现在什么样我说了算
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Cool. - Now it's anything I want it to be.

393
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,430
听起来很棒啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sounds awesome.

394
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,890
来吧  我带你们转转
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on. I'll show you around.

395
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,210
你们全都住在这里吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You guys all live here together?

396
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,900
我们跟别的家庭一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, we're just like any other family

397
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,430
只不过我们真的会照顾彼此
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}except we actually take care of each other.

398
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,120
你想见见他们吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You want to meet 'em?

399
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,170
-好啊  -来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Sure. - Come on.

400
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,990
蒂法  这里很吓人啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deva, this place freaks me out.

401
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,250
-来啊  会很好玩的  -我们不属于这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Come on, it'll be fun. - We don't belong here.

402
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,530
你要想走就走  我要留在这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you want to go, go. I'm staying.

403
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,300
好啦  大伙  这位是蒂法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, everybody, this is Deva.

404
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,880
那一位是  你叫什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And that's-- what's your name?

405
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,130
-比蒂  -比蒂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Beaty. - Beaty.

406
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,430
-好了  给你  -谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- All right, here you go. - Thank you.

407
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,430
他在等你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's waiting for you.

408
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,650
-叔叔  你找我  -是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You wanted to see me, Uncle? - Yeah.

409
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,050
费城来的朋友告诉我  你不太明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our friend from Philadelphia tells me you were a little confused

410
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,360
之前弗拉奇尔先生叫他转达的提议
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}about the offer he delivered from Mr. Frazier earlier today.

411
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,010
那不是提议  那是侮辱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It wasn't an offer. It was an insult.

412
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,880
这是修复大家长期以来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was a first step in repairing a long-standing

413
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,000
非常重要的商业关系的第一步
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and very important business relationship.

414
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,620
他们从我们的竞争对手那里买货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They were buying from our competition

415
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,100
而你要用降价来奖励他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you want to reward that with a discount?

416
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,670
他们是顾客  我想要赢回他们的生意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're the customer. I want to earn their business back.

417
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,690
小小的让步为了辉煌的明天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A small concession towards a bigger future.

418
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,030
但那不是我们商量好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But that's not what we agreed upon.

419
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,960
我已经同意了弗拉奇尔的条件
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I already agreed to Frazier's terms.

420
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,730
我们会降低单价
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We will reduce the unit price,

421
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,300
即刻停止所有对萨尔瓦多人的销售
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}stop all sales to the Salvadorans immediately.

422
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,560
明白吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that understood?

423
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,280
叔叔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uncle.

424
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,560
想清楚啊

425
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,340
听明白了吗  丽贝卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that understood, Rebecca?

426
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,050
-明白  -很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yes. - Good.

427
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:05,140
我叫你来  是觉得你会想要向雷诺克斯先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, I called you in because I'm sure you'd like to apologize

428
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,140
及他的同事们道个歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to Mr. Lennox and his associates for the misunderstanding.

429
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,490
对这个误会我深表歉意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I apologize for the misunderstanding.

430
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,080
下次不会了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It won't happen again.

431
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,920
很好  谢谢  丽贝卡  你可以走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good. Thank you, Rebecca. You can go now.

432
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,760
普罗科特先生  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you, Mr. Proctor.

433
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,650
滚出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get out.

434
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,380
都他妈的滚出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get the fuck out!

435
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:12,020
{\an8}没人要的婊子

436
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,790
如果你朝我开枪了  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you shoot me, motherfucker,

437
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,830
就什么生日礼物也别想拿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you ain't getting shit for your birthday.

438
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,540
你迟到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're late.

439
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,230
我先说清楚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now let me be clear.

440
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,640
我相信干掉切顿那个混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm trusting that taking out this Chayton motherfucker

441
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,510
你就能专心做事了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}will get you focused on the real work at hand.

442
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,420
-切顿在哪  -去你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Where's Chayton? - Fuck you.

443
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,190
他在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where is he?

444
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,180
进去

446
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,390
警长在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's the sheriff?

447
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,080
-冲进去  快  -是联邦调查局
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Move in! Now! - FBI!

448
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,530
赶快离开这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get the fuck out of here!

449
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,600
跪下  给我跪下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get on the ground! Get on the ground!

450
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,350

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get down!

456
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,340
别给我乱动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sit still, I said!

457
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,880
别动  切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't move, Chayton!

458
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:01,650
我不会再让他们抓我进监狱了  艾米
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not gonna let them put me in another cage, Aimee.

459
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,220
-你杀了警察  -那不是杀害
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You murdered a cop. - It's not murder.

460
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,950
是场战争
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's war.

461
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:08,140
我认识她  切顿  她不该死的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I knew her, Chayton. She didn't deserve to die.

462
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,190
她选择了当警察就要做好觉悟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She chose her fate when she put on that uniform.

463
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,810
别过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stop!

464
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,330
你不会朝我开枪的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not gonna shoot me.

465
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,680
必要时我会开的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will if I have to.

466
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,500
不  你不会的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, you won't.

467
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,390
你为什么不朝他开枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why the fuck didn't you shoot him, huh?

468
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,380
他去哪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where is he?

469
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,200
我他妈问你他去哪了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I said where the fuck is he?

470
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,500
别这么做  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't want to do that, sir.

471
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,190
你要为此负责  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll have your badge for this, fucker.

472
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,660
先排队吧你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get in fucking line.

473
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,860
天呐  我的天  这也太猛了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, man. Oh, my God, that was strong.

474
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,030
但很美妙  这是你的第一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That was amazing. That was your first one.

475
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,720
