{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where were you? I'm drowning out here.

3
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,200
抱歉  两份薄煎饼

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Enjoying the show? - Best seat in the house.

回见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll catch you later.

8
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,110
话说我们什么时候一起开车来上班啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So when are we gonna stop driving separate cars to work?

9
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,420
等我们住在一起的时候吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}As soon as we stop living at separate addresses.

10
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,180
-好吧  -我不是催你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Right. - I mean, I'm not pushing for that.

11
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,120
没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

12
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,300
没事  你可以小催一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's okay. You can push a little.

13
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,860
-是吗  -别太急就行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Oh, really? - Yeah, just a little.

14
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,250
有什么事吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can I help you?

15
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,600
我叫柯特·邦克  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My name is Kurt Bunker, sir.

16
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,720
我是来申请副警长一职的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm here to apply for the open deputy position.

17
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
逗我呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Seriously?

18
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,710
我知道我的外表可能让人误会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I understand that my physical appearance may be unsettling,

19
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,340
但我保证  很久之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I can assure you my ties

20
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,160
我就与印第安活动没有关系了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to the movement were severed long ago.

21
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,370
不过要除去我身上的纹身
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Unfortunately, the removal of my tattoos

22
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,250
需要的时间比预计长了点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}has taken longer than anticipated.

23
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,750
戴德郡警署
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dade County Sheriff's Department.

24
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,000
-离佛罗里达不近啊  -我出生在女妖镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You're a long way from Florida. - I was born in Banshee.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,100
我认为自己最好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just became prudent for me

26
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,610
远离以前的圈子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to distance myself from former associates.

27
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,760
那你为什么回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then why are you back?

28
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,260
我该回家了  警官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was time to come home, ma'am.

29
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,130
你以前的朋友对此是什么看法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do your former associates think about that?

30
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,840
他们怎么看与我无关
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What they think is none of my concern.

31
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,600
抱歉  邦克  我们已经有人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry, Bunker. Position's filled.

32
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,700
这个你留着吧  打扰了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can hold onto that. I appreciate your time.

33
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,390
他是真想来吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Was that for real?

34
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,530
我挺喜欢他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I kind of liked him.

35
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,710
-凯奇先生  -普罗科特先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Mr. Cage. - Mr. Proctor.

36
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,950
-你好吗  凯  -很好  谢谢前来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- How are you, Kai? - Good. Thanks for coming.

37
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,490
老友相邀我怎么能不来呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I couldn't turn down an invitation from an old friend.

38
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,050
这位美女是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who is this pretty young thing?

39
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,210
这是丽贝卡·鲍曼  我侄女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, that's Rebecca Bowman, my niece.

40
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,170
我要让她熟悉一下家族事业
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm introducing her to the family business.

41
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,990
普罗科特让这高中妞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Proctor pulled the kid out

42
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,490
离开学校来这里学习
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}of high school for a little show-and-tell.

43
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,360
马丁  怎么说话呢  放尊重点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Martin, watch your mouth. Show a little respect.

44
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,300
抱歉  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry, Kai.

45
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,810
话说你找我来干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So what was it you wanted to see me about?

46
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,920
老朋友  我们需要重申一下我们的约定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, old friend, we need to clarify our arrangement.

47
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,430
什么约定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What arrangement is that?

48
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,620
我的厂子关了三周
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}While my factory was down for three weeks,

49
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,100
费城的客户是你供的货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you began supplying my Philadelphia customers.

50
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,380
我知道其中的诱惑力  你也是看到了机会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I understand the impulse. You saw an opportunity.

51
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,690
但是我现在重新开张了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I'm up and running again now,

52
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,360
所以我们以前怎么办现在还怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so we got to go back to things as they were before.

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,210
我远离俄亥俄  你也不要打宾夕法尼亚的主意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I stay out of Ohio and you stay out of Pennsylvania.

54
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,490
你没供货  他们就来找我了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You couldn't supply them, they came to me.

55
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,980
仅此而已  只是生意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Plain and simple. Just business.

56
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,870
你搞砸了  普罗科特  哪有要回去的道理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You fucked up, Proctor. You don't get to take that back.

57
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,850
你刚才说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What did you just say?

58
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,160
你叔叔在女妖镇可能是个人物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your uncle may be a big deal here in Banshee,

59
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,150
但是在别人眼里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but in the rest of the world,

60
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,220
他就是个近亲结婚生下的杂种  还目中无人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he's just a country inbreed with an inflated ego.

61
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,850
-马丁  给我闭嘴  -我能处理  爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Martin, shut your mouth. - I got it, Dad.

62
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,280
我听说你以前是个厉害人物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I heard you were a scary dude back in the day,

63
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,940
-可他现在也不过如此啊  -马丁  闭...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- but he doesn't look so scary now, does he? - Martin, shut--

64
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,050
丽贝卡  不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rebecca, no!

65
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,430
善始善终
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Finish what you started.

66
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,230
不  不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. No.

67
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,020
刚跟斯柏林通完电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just got off the phone with Sperling.

68
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,190
普罗科特愿意承认私藏武器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Proctor will plead to a single misdemeanor weapons charge

69
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,690
不想进监狱服刑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in exchange for time served.

70
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,490
-我让他去死了  -同意他的条件
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I told him to go to hell. - Yeah, we'll make the deal.

71
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,730
什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

72
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,780
打电话给斯柏林  告诉他我们...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Call Sperling back and tell him that we'll--

73
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,800
我听到你说什么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I heard what you said.

74
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,780
那你还问什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then why are we still talking about it?

75
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,560
我们有机会解决普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We've got a shot at putting Proctor away

76
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,340
可你却想妥协  答应他们的条件
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you just want to roll over and play dead.

77
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,700
不  我厌倦了这场毫无希望的战斗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I'm done fighting battles I won't win.

78
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,910
你还在嗑药吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you still on the pills?

79
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,100
我已经戒了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I'm clean.

80
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,480
我--
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, I--

81
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,980
所以每一秒我都过得很清醒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I get to experience every single moment with total clarity.

82
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,670
不好意思  我得--
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, if you'll excuse me, I need to--

83
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,510
我得回去继续当市长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need to get back to being the mayor.

84
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,670
市长的职责又是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What does that entail, exactly?

85
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,360
等我搞清楚了会告诉你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll let you know when I figure it out.

86
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,660
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks.

87
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,600
你让我们去抢军事基地已经够糟了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bad enough you got us robbing a military base,

88
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,650
我们现在还得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}now we got to worry about all

89
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,880
提防亡命徒的追杀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}these motherfucking Rambos killing our asses.

90
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,520
上校让海军队员来守着钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, the colonel's got the Marines guarding the money.

91
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,460
他要这些雇佣兵干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell does he need the mercs for?

92
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,000
因为他们保护的可不是美国政府的钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cause it ain't Uncle Sam's cash they're protecting.

93
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,890
不是所有事都像童子军一样干净
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Turns out not everything is kosher at Boy Scout camp.

94
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,950
公开的记录是  保险柜里有九百万
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The official log accounts for nine million in that safe.

95
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,450
那不公开的记录呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What about the unofficial log?

96
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,100
那就将近一千五百万了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's saying closer to 15.

97
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,940
有人在做账
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Someone's cooking the books.

98
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,330
不是一般人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not just someone.

99
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,890
道格拉斯·斯通上校
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Colonel Douglas Stowe.

100
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,160
作为班里第一名从海军学院毕业
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Naval Academy grad, first in his class.

101
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,460
在贝鲁特  巴拿马和海地服过役
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tours in Beirut, Panama, and then Haiti.

102
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,350
之后他挑战了一下人生的其它可能
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}After that, he took a little walk on the wild side.

103
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,620
他在伊拉克和阿富汗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're talking about a string of nasty black ops

104
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,430
做了很多血腥的秘密任务
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in Iraq and Afghanistan.

105
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,000
这可不是个普通的坏人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This ain't just another bad motherfucker,

106
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,030
这是他们派来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}this the guy they send in

107
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,590
杀光其他坏人的坏人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to clean out all the other bad motherfuckers.

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,890
换句话说  黑吃黑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}On the other hand, you steal from a thief...

109
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,450
不会惊动警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}no one calls the cops.

110
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,220
警察不会带着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The cops won't come after

111
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,700
突击队和阿帕奇直升机来追我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}us with hit teams and Apache helicopters.

112
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,610
这里没人欢迎你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You are not welcome here.

113
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,370
凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kai.

114
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,160
请回避一下

115
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,370
你不用来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You did not have to come.

116
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,890
你发烧了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have a fever.

117
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,950
只是有点流感而已
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's just a touch of the flu.

118
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,290
喝点水吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Here, drink some water.

119
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,930
你怎么能任由她病着呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How can you allow this to go on?

120
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,970
医生来过  也开了药
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The doctor was here. He gave her medicine.

121
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,090
她需要的不是家庭医生  她得去医院
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She doesn't need a house call. She needs a hospital.

122
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,010
他明天还会来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He will be here again tomorrow.

123
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,310
我们会问他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We will ask him.

124
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,270
这还不够
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But that's not good enough.

125
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,080
-别碰她  -凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Leave her! - Oh, Kai.

126
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,930
让开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get out of my way.

127
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,780
我们能在家照顾好她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We can take care of her here.

128
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,770
你母亲已经是胰腺癌晚期了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your mother is suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer.

129
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,510
还剩多长时间  医生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How much time, Doctor?

130
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,690
一个月  甚至更短
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A month, maybe less.

131
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,230
我要把你放下来了  妈妈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm going to put you down, mother.

132
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,490
-你站得住吗  -没问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Can you stand? - Yeah.

133
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,260
普罗科特先生  你母亲要死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your mother is dying, Mr. Proctor.

134
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,640
你应该开始考虑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should start thinking

135
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,540
怎样让她好受些
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}about how you can make her most comfortable.

136
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,140
你还好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You okay?

137
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,840
在你回答之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Before you answer that.

138
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,650
别这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't.

139
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,690
停下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stop.

140
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,870
停
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stop!

141
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,410
我不能再这样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't do this anymore.

142
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,910
能给我个理由吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do I get an explanation?

143
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,140
理由重要吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Does it really matter?

144
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,220
-你老公  -不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Your husband? - No.

145
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,050
-有其他人了  -我没时间给其他人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Somebody else? - There's no time for anyone else.

146
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,940
我跟你都没时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There isn't even time for this.

147
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,300
那问题出在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then what's the problem?

148
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,930
我的孩子们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My kids.

149
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,030
他们需要母亲留在家里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They need their mother at home,

150
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,540
而不是溜出来跟人上床
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}not sneaking out at night for booty calls.

151
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,510
这跟孩子无关  是你的问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This isn't about your kids. It's about you.

152
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,990
别说了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't do that.

153
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,190
就当做个梦而已  没有其它意义
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is a bubble. This isn't anything.

154
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,660
我们有过的一切很棒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What we had was great,

155
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,910
但我得回到现实世界了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I've got to get back to the real world.

156
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,180
照顾好自己  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take care of yourself, okay?

157
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,570
好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right.

158
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,550
你很喜欢你的军人朋友啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You really like your military men.

159
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,140
你来这干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doing here?

160
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,150
我还想问你呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was gonna ask you the same thing.

161
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,570
我和谁睡都跟你没关系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who I fuck is none of your business.

162
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,940
影响到工作就和我有关了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It is when it affects the job.

163
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,850
那你和副警长有一腿又怎么算
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And how about you getting involved with your deputy sheriff?

164
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,010
那就不影响工作了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How does that affect the job?

165
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,640
你跟目标有关系我们就没法抢劫了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We can't do the heist if you're involved with the target.

166
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,390
我已经和他断了  行了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I already broke it off. Are we done?

167
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,730
我需要担心吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Should I be worried?

168
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,210
我说了我会准备好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I told you I'd be ready.

169
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,450
我不是指工作
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not talking about the job.

170
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,950
我得回家了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I gotta get home.

171
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,890
停火
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold your fire!

172
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,020
阿道夫·希特勒最喜欢的游戏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Adolf Hitler's favorite game

173
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,590
是牛仔对战印第安[对战游戏]
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}was cowboys and Indians.

174
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,720
他管俄国佬叫红皮肤[印第安人]
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He called the Russians redskins

175
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,160
并从白人对我们纳瓦霍族的种族清洗中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and found inspiration in the white man's

176
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,640
得到启发
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}ethnic cleansing of our Navajo kin.

177
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,080
现在普罗科特屠杀了我们的酋长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now Proctor has slaughtered our chief

178
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,470
还继续掠夺我们本当拥有的东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and continues to take what is rightfully ours.

179
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,970
维霍  桑纳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Viho, Songaa.

180
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,220
去把普罗科特和那个女孩抓来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go get Proctor and the girl.

181
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,630
带他们到这里来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bring them back here.

182
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,500
应该让我去抓普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should be the one getting Proctor.

183
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,170
现在还不是时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not now.

184
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,290
我还有别的事要你做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've got other plans for you.

185
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,700
切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton.

186
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,170
这里每个人都觉得我能在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everyone here thinks I get a free ride

187
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,090
是因为我是你的兄弟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'cause I'm your brother.

188
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,320
我要做给他们看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need to show them.

189
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,230
你要有耐心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You need to be patient.

190
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,450
艾莉森
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alison.

191
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,690
我需要你在认罪协议上签字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need your signature on the plea deal

192
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,030
才能提交
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}before I can file.

193
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,260
请进
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come in.

194
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,140
我在里边加了未来犯罪条款
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I included a future crime clause.

195
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,050
就算普罗科特拿了张罚单
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If Proctor gets so much as a speeding ticket,

196
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,630
我们也可以撤回认罪协议  重审此案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we can revoke the plea deal and reopen the case.

197
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,310
要喝点什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can I pour you a drink?

198
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,610
-不用了  -好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm fine. - All right.

199
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,940
请自便
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Suit yourself.

200
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,310
我喜欢这间新公寓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I like the new apartment.

201
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,450
作为一名律师  你谎撒得真差劲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, you know, for a lawyer, you're a pretty shitty liar.

202
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,420
好吧  你至少要装一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, you have to at least put in some effort.

203
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,240
把孩子们的房间准备好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Set up the kids' rooms.

204
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,990
挂上些照片
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hang pictures.

205
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,660
在厨房里做顿饭让这里闻起来像个家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Start cooking in the kitchen so it smells like home.

206
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,830
你会做饭吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah. You cook?

207
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,670
会一点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I dabble.

208
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,260
不如你留下来教教我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you stick around and teach me?

209
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,670
戈登  我知道你最近经历了一番折磨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gordon, I know you've been through the wringer,

210
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,220
但是你得振作起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but you've got to get it together.

211
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,000
-我刚刚有点出格了  -你以为呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- That was out of line. - You think?

212
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,680
艾莉森  你不用非得走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alison, look, you don't have to go.

213
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,650
我非常尊敬你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I respect you too much

214
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,510
没办法看你这样作践自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to watch you embarrass yourself like this.

215
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,890
诺拉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nola.

216
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,450
我想过你会入乡随俗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I thought you'd gone native,

217
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,770
但是这个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but this...

218
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,230
真是大开眼界
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}this is a whole new level.

219
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,360
我很高兴你喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm glad you like it.

220
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,250
我很高兴你觉得我会喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm glad you think I like it.

221
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,520
我想过你会不会回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wondered if you'd come back.

222
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,100
我也想过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I wondered the same thing.

223
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,530
每次我觉得我可以摆脱这个鬼地方了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Every time I think I'm rid of this goddamn place--

224
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,690
-这里是你的家  -这是你的家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- This place is your home. - It's your home!

225
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,070
不是我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not mine.

226
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,480
你是奇诺族女人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You are a Kinaho woman.

227
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,270
不知道倒了什么霉要在这里长大
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fat lot of good that did me growing up here.

228
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,210
我知道你以前遭了不少罪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know you suffered greatly back then.

229
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,540
你以为你知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You think you know.

230
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,790
-诺拉  -怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Nola. - What?

231
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,060
让我死了吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me die.

232
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,590
我们在新奥尔良就谈过这个问题了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We already had this conversation in New Orleans.

233
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,070
能别再谈了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can we not do it again?

234
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,850
你已经死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're already dead.

235
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,570
你哥哥的事我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm very sorry about your brother.

236
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,110
-你瞧不起亚历克斯  -我可怜他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You despised Alex. - I pitied him.

237
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,260
他忘了他是谁  但他的死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He forgot who he was, but his murder

238
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,100
是个悲剧  我们会为他报仇的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}was a tragedy and we will avenge it.

239
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,390
所以往普罗科特家派了一群混混吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}By sending a couple of gangbangers to Proctor's house?

240
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,320
他们能处理好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They can handle it.

241
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,060
亚历克斯的死是因为他低估了普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alex is dead because he underestimated Proctor.

242
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,580
恕我直言  我不是亚历克斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}With all due respect, I am not Alex.

243
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,330
不  不  你不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. No, you're not.

244
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,990
亚历克斯不喜欢你  他认为你会危害到部落
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alex never liked you. He thought you were bad for the tribe.

245
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,200
我就是部落
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am the tribe.

246
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,240
我根本不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I really don't care.

247
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,060
诺拉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nola.

248
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,800
别妨碍我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't get in my way.

249
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,810
他是我哥哥  切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He was my brother, Chayton.

250
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,830
你会让他们血债血偿的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you will have your blood.

251
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,810
-但是要听令于你  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- When you say? - Yes.

252
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,770
不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

253
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,890
基地下埋着一条古老的汽管隧道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's an old steam tunnel buried underneath the base.

254
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,470
就像我们的贵宾通道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's like our own personal VIP entrance.

255
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,470
我们进来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're in.

256
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,700
好的  你们要小心点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, now y'all be careful down there.

257
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,410
你懂的  蛇之类的玩意儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, snakes and what not.

258
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,670
你先上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}After you.

259
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,840
就像过去一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just like old times.

260
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,400
那个保险箱研究得怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So how we doing with the vault?

261
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,400
根据你的描述来看  应该是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Based on your description, it has to be a JT-3000

262
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,900
在弗吉尼亚州定制的JT3000
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}custom-built in Virginia.

263
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,650
-有几道锁  -两道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- How many locks? - Two.

264
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,770
一道机械锁加一道电子锁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One mechanical, the other digital.

265
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,670
如果我们能破解滚动加密代码
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If we get past the rolling encryption code,

266
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,250
我就得在钢筋外壳上钻个六英吋深的洞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll have to drill through six inches of reinforced steel

267
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,140
破坏制动系统
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to disable the tumbler system.

268
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,670
贾伯能破解密码
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job can handle the encryption code.

269
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,270
-每12分钟变一次  -那我们最好快点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It changes every 12 minutes. - We'll have to work fast, then.

270
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,860
-你是说我吧  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- And by we, you mean me. - Yep.

271
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,840
-你找我吗  长官  -坐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You wanted to see me, sir? - Sit.

272
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,500
在阿富汗时  我的小队专门执行黑色行动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My unit was point for black ops in Afghanistan.

273
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,430
回收赃物  抢物资  尽干些脏活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Asset recovery, bag grabs, the dirty stuff.

274
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,200
有天晚上我们受到攻击
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One night we came under fire.

275
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,190
还不是什么游兵散将
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not just a couple of insurgents with small arms,

276
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,990
而是一群全副武装的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}dozens of them all armed to the teeth.

277
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,190
有人给他们通风报信
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Someone had tipped them off.

278
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,000
我呼叫了空中增援  但迟迟不来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I called for air support, but it never came.

279
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,220
总统的撤军命令意味着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}President's troop reductions meant less support

280
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,350
对战场上士兵的增援变少了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for soldiers still on the ground.

281
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,360
只有墨菲和我逃了出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Murphy and I were the only ones to make it out.

282
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,550
那次袭击让七名好汉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The powers that be let seven good men,

283
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,770
爱国者  因政治而死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}patriots, die for politics.

284
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,380
所以我只信任我自己的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why I only trust my people.

285
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,910
这是在你床铺下的地板下找到的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This was found beneath a floorboard under your bunk.

286
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,000
这不是我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not mine.

287
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,970
你是个傻瓜  哈多克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're an idiot, Haddock.

288
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,350
我本可以让你赚大钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I could have made you rich

289
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,720
但你却搞砸了  为了什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you blew it, for what?

290
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,420
-三万元  -长官  我发誓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- 30 grand? - Sir, I swear--

291
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,380
我准你站起来了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did I tell you to stand?

292
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,880
把他关起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lock him in the brig.

293
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,440
感觉太容易了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Seems too easy.

294
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,790
可能斯托不知道隧道的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe Stowe doesn't know about the tunnel.

295
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,350
他知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He knows.

296
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,020
我们被一扇铁门挡住了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got a solid steel door blocking us.

297
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,130
有多厚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How thick?

298
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,650
大概12英吋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}About 12 inches.

299
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,070
-装药爆破吗  -这不是我的台词吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Shape charges? - Now you're talking my language.

300
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,750
等等  如果那些墙壁的牢固性不好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now hold on. If those walls are not properly reinforced,

301
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,950
你的台词估计会让这个隧道都塌了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}your language will bring down the whole damn tunnel.

302
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,160
你想怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you suggest?

303
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,030
我会把门的铰链拆了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, I'll pull the door off the hinges

304
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,520
比较老式的办法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the old-fashioned way.

305
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,420
说的好像你还知道别的方法似的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Like you got any other motherfucking way.

306
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,490
报告  所有房间安全
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Checking in. All rooms secure.

307
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,470
去找普罗科特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go find Proctor.

308
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,130
我饿死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm starving.

309
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,350
冰箱里有些肉馅土豆馅饼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's some shepherd's pie in the fridge.

310
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,570
牛肉的还是火鸡的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ooh, beef or turkey?

311
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,720
我已经不吃红肉了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I stopped eating red meat.

312
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,390
你也应该这么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should, too.

313
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,080
那不可能
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

314
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,390
这样吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what?

315
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,170
我去做点吃的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll make us something to eat.

316
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,420
做点三文治我们吃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll make us some sandwiches.

317
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,780
你这有午餐肉吗  冷切肉呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got some lunch meat? Some cold cuts?

318
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,270
布罗克  你当前在什么位置  完毕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brock, what's your current location, over?

319
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,890
不要  她可以找别人的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't. She'll find somebody else.

320
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,360
我还在工作  给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm still on duty. Give it to me.

321
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,730
-别管了...  -快点给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Just let it-- - Come on, give it to me.

322
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,730
-我没跟你开玩笑  小艾  -不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm not messing around, Em. - Come on.

323
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,620

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uh, yeah, this is Brock. Go ahead, Alma.

325

接到普罗科特家的骚乱报警
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got a call of a disturbance at the Proctor place.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job still comes first, huh?

329
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,800
-别这样  -跟过去一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Come on. - Just like the old days.

330
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,750
小艾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Em.

331
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,050
你想要我怎样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you want from me?

332
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,790
我想要你离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want you to leave.

跟你说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what?

334
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,980
你想啥来啥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're in luck.

335
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,990
需要把所有东西都拍给我看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need pictures of everything.

336
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,610
告诉她这次一定要集中注意力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell her to keep it in focus this time.

337
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,990
我能听到你说话  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can hear you, Job.

在普罗科特家的泳池里找到一名DOA
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, we got a DOA in Proctor's pool.

342
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,090

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You started this war when you took out Longshadow.

356
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,140
是的  开战了你会知道的  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, well, you would know about starting wars, Sheriff.

357
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,730
切顿还是会来找你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton's not gonna stop coming for you.

358
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,010
那是切顿不走运了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's unfortunate for Chayton

359
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,250
任何来找我的人都一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and anyone else who comes after what's mine.

360
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,630
我跟你说明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, let me be clear.

361
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,360
你们两边斗成什么样是你们的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You and the Redbones can tear each other apart.

362
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,170
老子不管  他妈的给我快点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't give a shit. Just hurry the fuck up.

363
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,180
我家被这些下等人侵犯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My house was violated by these lowlifes.

364
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,840
干好你的活  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You do your job, Sheriff.

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,510
你了解居留地  从哪开始
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know the reservation. Where do we start?

367
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,610
我们不能就这么去居留地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We can't just go to the reservation.

368
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,220
我们可以  我一直都这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, we can. I do it all the time.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A lot of Redbones hang out here.

372
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,980
酒便宜  还不会有人来找麻烦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Drinks are cheap and nobody bothers them.

373
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,820
看看我们能做什么吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hmm, well, let's see what we can do about that.

374
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,820

比利  你知道不该穿这身制服来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Billy, you know better than to show up here in that uniform.

379
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,240
你就告诉我有没有看到切顿吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then just tell me if you've seen Chayton.

380
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,690
-滚出去  -有人在受伤
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Get the hell out of here. - People are getting hurt.

381
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,430
我们的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our people.

382
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,390
我只知道他们在丛林深处
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All I know is that they're deep in the woods.

383
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,670
丛林深处什么地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where abouts in the woods?

谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks for your time.

386
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,320
你觉得你老爹要是知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you think your old man would say

387
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,060
你听一个白小子的命令  他会说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}if he knew you were taking orders from the white man?

388
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,910
-让开  斯派奇  -不然呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Move, Spatch. - Or what?

389
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,180
你一定要玩这套吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You sure that's how you want to play this?

390
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,000
你的警徽

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}don't mean shit around here.

392
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,760
警徽是你最不用担心的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, the badge is the last thing you should worry about.

393
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,400

你怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What happened to you?

412
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,920
我  我发生了意外
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-- I had an accident.

413
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,270
你有给伤口上药吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, have you put anything on those cuts?

诺提  斯派奇找我们茬儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Notie and Spatch were looking for a fight.

420
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,220
找事的是你们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You were looking for a fight.

421
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,740
穿着女妖镇的警服来这儿干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you thinking going to the Dog Iron in a BSD uniform?

422
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,240
-他是跟着我来的  -我没跟你说话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He was following me. - I wasn't talking to you.

423
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640

00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,510
-你认识他吗  -他是认真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You know him? - Is he serious?

-我们一起的  -滚出保留地  比利

如果雅兹发现你在这儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If Yaz finds out that you're out here--

427
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,410
等等  雅兹是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's Yaz?

428
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,470
卡尔·雅兹  奇诺警局的警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Karl Yazzie. Chief of the Kinaho PD.

429
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,950
听起来我应该见见这人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sounds like someone I should meet.

430
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,070
我们走  我带你去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go. I'll take you.

00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,540
钻进车里  赶紧离开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and drive away if you know what's good for you.

433
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,600
我看起来像是识相的人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do I look like someone who knows what's good for him?

434
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,230
警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chief.

435
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,130
你一定是来错地方了  小子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You must have made a wrong turn, boy.

436
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,990
这里是奇诺警署
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is the Kinaho Police Department.

437
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,290
-这位是谁  -卢卡斯·胡德警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- And who do we have here? - Sheriff Lucas Hood.

438
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,950
就是你逮捕了杀柯利瑞的混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You busted that fat bastard that killed the Cleary girl.

439
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,620
我很惊讶你知道这事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm surprised you know about that,

440
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,490
那就是你懒得帮忙了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}seeing as you didn't lift a finger to help.

441
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,440
是在你的辖区发生的  不是我的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Happened on your beat, not mine.

442
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,470
我只管好我辖区的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I stay on my side of the line.

443
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,480
好吧  切顿和红骨帮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, well, Chayton and the Redbones,

444
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,060
他们洗劫了一辆热那亚基地的军车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}they hijacked a truck from Camp Genoa.

445
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,260
偷了大概十二箱的AK和M4
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stole about a dozen crates of AKs and M4s.

446
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,860
-什么  何时发生的  -听起来是军方的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What? When? - Sounds like a military issue.

447
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,810
如果枪在女妖镇出现  就归我管
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not if the guns end up in Banshee.

448
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:35,610
抱歉  我不知道他在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry, I can't tell you where the man is if I don't know.

449
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,400
但我们会留意他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But we'll keep an eye out for him.

450
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,110
你们会留意的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'll keep an eye out?

451
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,130
事不关己  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}None of your business, huh?

452
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,720
-我们走  -还有件事  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Let's go. - Oh, one other thing, Sheriff.

453
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,180
-什么  -出于礼貌我叫你警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah? - I call you sheriff as a courtesy,

454
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,640
即使你在这儿什么都不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}even though out here you've got no standing.

455
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,850
下次你再搞出今天这样的屁事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The next time you pull some shit like you did today,

456
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,520
我就报告印第安事务局  烦死你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna have BIA crawling all over your ass.

457
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,780
咱还是各管各的吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You mind your own backyard and we'll mind ours.

458
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,330
比利
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Billy.

459
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:11,940
你也一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That goes for you, too.

460
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,490
雅兹是坏警察吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So Yaz is dirty?

461
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,360
不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

462
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,800
他没那么有野心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That would actually require ambition.

463
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,190
他只是很久以前就放弃了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yazzie gave up on that a long time ago.

464
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,000
部落议会和红骨帮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Between the tribal council and the Redbones,

465
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,290
他都不得罪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he's everyone's bitch.

466
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,710
-那个姑娘呢  -艾米吗  她是个狠角色
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What about the girl? - Aimee? She's the real deal.

467
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,810
她只是不想碌碌无为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She just wants to make a difference.

468
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,000
她不太喜欢你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She doesn't like you much.

469
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,640
对  她觉得我抛弃了她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, she feels I abandoned her.

470
