你最好去拿把枪毙了我
Might as well just get the strap out of the center console

140
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,540
不让我归队
and put me down if I can't get back in the game,

141
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,020
就把我毙了吧
just go ahead and end it for me.

142
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,580
结束我的痛苦 无所谓
Just put me out of my misery, it's fine.

143
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,980
布里格 回家吧 这是命令
Briggs, get home safe. That's an order.

144
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,540
长官 你要去哪？长官
Sir, where are you goin'? Sir!

145
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,500
长官
Sir!

146
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,560
空降了
Airborne!

147
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,390
布里格上士还真是个狠角色
Staff Sergeant Briggs is a total badass, huh?

148
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,350
嗨 上尉
Oh, hey, Captain.

149
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,010
就猜到你还在
Figured I'd find you still here.

150
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,440
梳洗一下
Get yourself together.

151
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,620
30分钟后来部队找我
Come meet me in Battalion in 30.

152
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,620
你要帮我打电话了？
Does that mean you're gonna make the call?

153
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,150
上尉 大家都在说你坏话
Hey, Captain, all the guys talk shit about you,

154
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,580
但我就知道你是好人
but I always knew you had a heart of gold,

155
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,100
上尉好棒棒
and I was like, "Not my captain.

156
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,930
你不是烂人
No."

157
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,220
{\an8}（刘易斯堡）

158
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,350
{\an8}（刘易斯麦克乔德联合基地）

159
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,240
{\an8}（宪兵）

160
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,340
-你好 -嗨
- What's up, man? - Howdy.

161
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,170
谢谢
Thank you.

162
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,520
证件过期了
It's expired, sir.

163
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,350
别这样
Oh, come on, man.

164
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,040
我进出这里像家一样
You know how many times I've been in and out of this gate with that?

165
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,610
你说啥？
Excuse me?

166
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,830
我看起来像恐怖分子吗？
Okay, think about it. What's the odds I'm ISIS?

167
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,570
先生 请下车
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

168
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,840
你要我下车？
You want me to step out of the vehicle...

169
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,190
-喂 -我很乐意
- Hey. - ...I'll happily...

170
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,320
他是游骑兵部队
He's with the Ranger battalion.

171
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,670
游骑兵很威吧
Ranger battalion.

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,580
证件早该作废了
You're required to dispose of this.

173
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,980
你说啥？什么？
What did you say? I'm sorry, what?

174
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,770
感谢你为国效力
Thank you for your service.

175
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,600
我会为祖国积极与敌作战
Energetically will I meet the enemies of my country!

176
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,870
我将在战场上击败敌人
I shall defeat them on the field of battle!

177
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,300
依靠良好的训练
For I am better trained.

178
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,930
全力攻敌
And will fight with all my might!

179
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,400
游骑兵誓死不屈
Surrender is not a Ranger word.

180
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,310
我绝不会舍弃倒下的战友
I'll never leave a fallen comrade...

181
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,870
我的停车位不能停
What? Y'all gave away my parking spot.

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,610
害我走好远
I had to walk all the way from the DFAC.

183
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,180
-继续保持 -你们要去哪？
- Keep pushing. - Where are y'all headed?

184
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,570
我们24小时内要降落在叙利亚
We're wheels down in Syria in 24 hours.

185
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,530
运输机正在装机
C-17 is loading up as we speak.

186
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,100
感谢长官
Look, sir, I really appreciate this,

187
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,580
我不会让你失望
I ain't gonna let you down.

188
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,890
为了归队我已经
I've been working the last three years

189
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:44,970
准备三年了
to get it straight for this job.

190
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,450
真中听
That's what I like to hear.

191
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,630
就说要当作举起你老妈
Kennelo, what did I say about using your mom's weights? Like...

192
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,980
我倒想练到能把到你妈
I'm trying to look good for your mom.

193
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,680
我只是建议
Well, I'm just trying to say, just...

194
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,030
用股四头肌
I don't know, more quads.

195
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,420
帮你生个弟弟
Gonna give you a baby brother.

196
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,860
你打算干嘛？
So what do you gotta do? Interview me or something

197
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,030
给我问话 确定我头壳没坏？
to make sure I've got a brain cell left, or...

198
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,820
对 之类的
Yeah, something like that.

199
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,820
一切你说了算 那好
Well, you say, "Jump," I say, "How high?"

200
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,470
等等 你的办公室不是这边？
Wait, isn't your office this way?

201
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,650
是又怎样
Sure is.

202
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,870
基南 莱利的遗物准备好了？
Riley's stuff just about ready, Kiernan?

203
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,310
快好了 长官
Just about, sir.

204
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,310
你还好吗？
You good, man?

205
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,360
还行 老样子
Yeah, man. It is what it is.

206
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,790
{\an8}（《给战争一个机会》）

207
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,670
莱利确实值得敬重
Riley was about as solid as they come.

208
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,580
听说他超速撞树
Tell that to the tree he hit doin' 120.

209
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,710
基南 走吧
All right, Kiernan, let's go, come on.

210
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,000
{\an8}（露露 《爱自己》）

211
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,500
狗要怎么处理？
What's gonna happen to his dog?

212
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,280
我就等你这句话
Thought you'd never ask.

213
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,110
周日家属要在诺加利斯举办葬礼
Family funeral's Sunday outside of Nogales.

214
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,380
她是贵宾
She's the guest of honor.

215
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,550
有够天才
Oh, that's... That's a genius idea.

216
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,380
希望她不会先把人给吃了
I hope she doesn't eat everybody first.

217
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,860
那就要看你了
Well, that part will be up to you.

218
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,260
等等 啥？
Wait, wait, what?

219
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,210
准备好了？拼了
Ready? Get it!

220
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,080
我们昨晚送走莱利的遗体
We sent Riley's body off late last night.

221
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,150
今早他母亲来电
And his mother called this morning.

222
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,870
她要他的爱犬出席葬礼
She wants his hero dog at the funeral.

223
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,180
你要我搭飞机把狗送到亚利桑那州？
Sir, are you asking me to fly a damn dog to Arizona?

224
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,270
不 是开车送游骑犬到亚利桑那州
No, I'm asking you to drive a Ranger to Arizona.

225
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,580
她不肯坐飞机
She refuses to fly.

226
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,740
她为什么不跟你们派驻？
Why ain't she deploying with you?

227
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,200
她不和任何人合作 一会很乖
Won't work with anyone. One minute she's good,

228
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,030
一会把三个人咬成重伤
the next minute, she's sending three guys to the ER.

229
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,000
你们受伤后 莱利顾着她
Riley kept trying after you guys got blown up,

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,190
但她现在没用了
but she's gone all the way.

231
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,290
莱利在超速撞树前
Maybe Riley should have thought of that

232
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,150
早该考虑到
before he broke the speed of sound into a tree.

233
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,380
游骑兵老爱寻死
Yeah, well, Rangers find a way to die.

234
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,680
等等 让我搞清楚
Hold on, let me get this straight,

235
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,940
要是我答应 你就会打电话
so I agree to do this, and you're gonna call Black Canopy

236
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,010
加速我的申请？
and get my packet pushed.

237
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,250
你答应 我就打电话 别搞砸
You do this, and then I make the call, no screw-ups,

238
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,180
不准添麻烦
nothing gets back to me.

239
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,340
完事后去白沙基地
After the service, you drop off on base down at White Sands,

240
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,860
他们会处理后续
they'll handle the rest.

241
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,510
白沙？要给她安乐死？
White Sands? So they're just gonna put her down anyway.

242
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,950
没有饲主或警局会疯到想收养她
There's not a handler or a PD crazy enough to adopt her up.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,310
我们也不乐见 但没辙
Doesn't make us feel warm and fuzzy inside. Just is what it is.

244
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,480
那我把她放生 你打电话
How about I disappear her ass, you make the call,

245
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,650
咱们皆大欢喜 好主意吧
and we both go on with our lives? How about that?

246
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,610
你完成任务 我就会挺你
You stick your neck out for Battalion, I'll stick mine out for you.

247
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,350
-不要拉倒 -长官
- Take it or leave it. - Sir...

248
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,530
准备来接你的暴冲狗了？
Ready to pick up your furry flash-bang?

249
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,790
我是奉命而来
That's what I'm told, man.

250
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,750
听好 这只狗转性了
Here's the deal, Briggs, this isn't the same dog you served with,

251
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,110
战争经历让她变得好斗
she's got every combat trigger in the book.

252
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,020
看紧她 别带她到公共场合
So you keep her secured and you don't take her out in public.

253
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,760
懂吗？
We clear?

254
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,810
好
All right.

255
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,210
有人问 就说要送她去复健
If anyone asks, say she's on her way to rehabilitation.

256
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,780
要我解开她吗？
Hey, do you want me to leash her up for you?

257
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,300
我自己动手
No, let's just get this over with.

258
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,340
好吧
All right.

259
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,740
你好 狗狗
What's up, dog?

260
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,570
记得我吗？
You remember me?

261
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,570
你几年前最爱拿我来磨牙了
Your favorite chew toy from 2015.

262
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,190
没印象？
Huh?

263
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,800
我和你要上路了
Me and you are gonna go on a little road trip.

264
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,890
超过1500英里
Fifteen hundred miles.

265
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,410
你爹地会在天上保佑我们
Just to act like your daddy's looking down on us from above.

266
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,410
好 我要解开你了
All right, I'm gonna leash you up.

267
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,070
好吗
All right?

268
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,510
冷静 别激动
Be cool. Easy.

269
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,640
冷静
Easy.

270
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,730
你真的认命了？
You really did give up, huh?

271
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,000
你们怕什么？她很乖啊
What are y'all so scared of? She's milding out big-time.

272
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,480
住手
Stop!

273
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,570
不要
Enough!

274
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,220
老兄 忘了提醒你别碰她耳朵
Hey, man, I forgot to tell you not to touch her on the ears, man.

275
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,610
我漏掉重点
I left that part out.

276
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,620
她戒了抗忧郁药
Hey, we weaned her off the Prozac,

277
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,400
有时会喜怒无常
so she might get moody from time to time.

278
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,100
嘴套一次只能戴2小时
Her muzzle can only stay on

279
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,930
不然她会热衰竭
for about two hours at a time or she'll overheat.

280
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,630
记得食物里要放水
Make sure you put water in her food,

281
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,240
还有别碰她的耳朵
and as you know, don't touch her ears.

282
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,630
最后就是她的纪录本
Other than that, here's your Bible.

283
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,020
-旅途愉快 -回头见 基南
- Have a good trip. - See you, Trent.

284
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,550
谢谢长官
Thank you, sir.

285
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,160
罗利兹背包里的遗物都还给家属
All the belongings in Sergeant Rodriguez's backpack go to his family.

286
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,770
他们想要他的军服陪葬
They want his uniform at the funeral.

287
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,250
本子则是露露的
The "I Love Me" book, that stays with Lulu.

288
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,900
遇到麻烦时 翻翻她的信息
If you have any trouble, all her info's in there.

289
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,430
我们不会去太久
I'm not gonna be out there long enough.

290
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,300
-嘿 -游骑兵做先锋
- Hey. - Rangers lead the way, sir.

291
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,430
勇往直前
All the way.

292
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,700
-保重 -兄弟
- Good luck. - All right, boys.

293
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,090
看来布里格终于把到妹了
Looks like Briggs finally got a girl.

♪♪ Can't try much harder To get back to water ♪♪

296

多莉 又是我杰克森布里格
Hey, Dorith, this is Jackson Briggs again.

299
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,990
我打来跟你们说
I was just calling to let you guys know

300
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,610
我只坐商务舱
that I only fly business class

301
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,740
飞去中东国家
to countries with names that end in "stan."

302
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,520
我们还没收到你的推荐
Sir, we're still missing your recommendation.

303
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,260
你讲到重点
Uh, look, it's actually what I was callin' about.

304
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,000
周一的一大早
So, first thing Monday morning, uh,

305

第二游骑兵部队琼斯上尉
you'll be getting a call from Captain Luke Jones

306
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,360
会打给你
from Second Ranger Battalion.

307
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,140
只要周三前你的上尉打来
If we hear from your captain before Wednesday,

308
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,710
我就会通知区安官安排你的轮调
I'll let the RSO know to expect you on rotation.

309
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,410

Yes, ma'am, I'm very, very happy to be working with...

310

我听不清楚
Yes, sir, I can't hear you...

311
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,150
女士 感激不尽
Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am, thank you so much. I... Okay.

312
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,410
怎么了？
What?

313
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,160
你有什么毛病啦
What is your deal, man?

314
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,590
拜托
Come on.

315
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,420
椅子上都是你的口水
You're just slobbering all over my seat.

316
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,950
别发疯
Maybe just take the crazy down.

317
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,080
冷静一点
Just like one notch.

318
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,910
也许我们能相处愉快
Just one notch, that's it, and maybe we could get along.

319
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,390
这样也许我们就能开心玩
And if we get along, maybe we could even have some fun

320
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,000
好好和莱利道别
and send Riley off right.

你只有我了
I'm all you got, I'm it.

323
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,920
就是这样 你没得选
It's just me.

324
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,710
说实话 我也不想整天给你戴嘴套
Believe it or not, I don't wanna keep you all muzzled up 24/7.

325
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,450
我真的不想
I really don't.

326
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,760
还有 我也不想直接
And to be honest, I don't wanna drive

327
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,060
开到荒凉的沙漠小镇

328
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,510
坐在汽车旅馆干瞪着墙五天
and just sit in a motel and stare at a wall for five days

329
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,420
枯等他的葬礼
waiting for his funeral.

330

对吧？
Do you?

331
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,600
别吵了行不行 好啦
Come on, man. Okay, okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

332
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,340
我要脱下嘴套了
All right. So I gotta take your muzzle off,

333
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,170
敢咬我
but if you bite me,

334
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,820
你就给我整路戴着
I'm gonna leave it on all the way to Arizona.

破门而入 赶尽杀绝
we had fun kicking in doors, getting our murder on.

放轻松 我不是坏人
Relax, I'm not the bad guy.

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,910
集体屠杀
for the corporate elite.

413
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,820
那些石油大亨
All these big oil fat cats,

414
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,220
自以为掌控这里
they think that they own this place.

415
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,480
自以为掌控大地
They think they own Mother Earth,

416
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,000
谁都不能霸占大地
but no one owns Mother Earth,

417
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,790
我这辈子每天都要对抗他们
and I'm gonna fight against them every day for the rest of my life

418
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,750
我可不想看到鸭子在油上游泳
because it's just not 'cause I don't wanna see those ducks in the goo.

419
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,360
听着 邀请50个
Look, and if you invite 50

420
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,660
IG朋友就半价
of your Instagram friends, you get half off.

421
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,540
-我有什么好处？酷喔 -我请喝酒
- What does this get me? Cool. - Free drink. On me.

422
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,930
绝对不能
No, no, no, no version of you

423
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,500
让女生请客 我买单
ever paying my bill. Please, no chance.

424
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,770
要我待会过来吗？
Would you like me to come right back?

425
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,190
不用了
No, we're good, I promise.

426
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
不能让她掏钱
Her money is no good here.

427
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,110
我来就好
I got it.

428
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
今晚我对自己说 你一定很爱
Tonight, I said to myself, you're gonna love this,

429
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,860
我说「你会遇到建筑工人或军人」
I said, "You will meet a construction worker or a soldier."

430
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,380
-这可妙了 -或是
- That's interesting. - Or, I don't know,

431
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,950
没有白人优越感的人
any man without a white savior complex.

432
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,910
祝好运
Good luck.

433
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,480
等等 什么？
Wait, what?

434
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,390
你最好去看精神科
I hope that you get the help that you need.

435
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,260
-感谢请客 -别走 听着
- Thanks for the drink. - No, no. Look, look,

436
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,090
听着 我被塔利班射杀耶
look, hey, I've been trapped by the Taliban.

437
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,350
我们走吧
We gotta get outta here

438
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,270
这里的妹子
because you are about the only woman in this entire city

439
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,280
都没你好聊
that I would actually like to have a conversation with.

440
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,670
我们和好吧
Here, this is a peace offering.

441
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,150
你冷静 我就会冷静 来
Be chill, and I'll be chill with you. Here.

442
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,980
我也不想对你下药
Look, I didn't want to drug you.

443
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,850
谁叫你咬烂我椅子 说真的
You didn't have to eat my seats, that's all I'm saying.

444
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,510
我们能当朋友 我只是以牙还牙
We can be friends, but this is gonna be an eye for an eye.

445
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,950
你要和好？
Are we gonna be cool?

446
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,290
还是继续跟我斗？
Or do we need to have another meeting of the mind?

447
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,780
随便 你不信我？
Fine, you don't wanna trust me, fine.

448
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,340
我懒得鸟你
I don't even care.

449
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,820
反正我也不信任你
I definitely don't trust you, so whatever.

450
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,170
那是比利时牧羊犬？
Is that a Belgian Mal?

451
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,090
是啊
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is.

452
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,010
-她好漂亮 -甜心
- She's beautiful. - Hi, sweet girl.

453
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,830
-你是搜救犬？-算吧
- Are you a rescue? - Uh, sort of.

454
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,180
她喜欢狗狗同伴吗？
Does she like other dogs?

455
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,880
算了
No, um, no, no.

456
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,620
其实她现在有点烦闷
Actually she's, um, she's a little sad right now.

457
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,840
她有点烦闷
She's... She's, um, grieving.

458
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,110
她失去了伙伴
She lost her best friend.

459
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,190
好惨 甜心
Oh, no, sweetheart.

460
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,550
这两个小可爱叫什么名字？
I know. Who are... Who are these little cuties?

461
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,720
-这是露西 -这是玛吉
- Oh, this is Lucy. - This is Maggie.

462
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,550
她们好可爱
Aw, they're so cute.

463
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,590
-是西施犬 -太棒了
- They're Shih Tzus. - They're great.

464
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,420
我爱西施犬
Oh, I love Shih Tzus.

465
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,030
-给你 -谢谢
- Here you go. - Thank you.

466
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,860
干杯
Cheers.

467
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,640
我差点放弃这城市 幸好遇到你们
I was about to give up on this city before I met y'all.

468
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,080
波特兰不是老少咸宜
Well, Portland's not for everybody.

469
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,870
谁知道 我开始喜欢这里了
I don't know, it's growin' on me.

470
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,390
又不是每天能遇到两个「植物音乐家」正妹
It's not every day you meet two plant musician ladies.

471
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,740
我们其实是坦陀罗教徒
We're actually Tantrikas.Um...

472
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,400
好
Okay.

473
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,880
我们有时也会充当入神圆舞的DJ
We DJ ecstatic dance circles sometimes, though.

474
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,660
像瑜伽吗？
That's sick. Is that, like... That's like yoga?

475
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,800
我做过瑜伽 但我超逊的
I've done yoga. But I'm horrible at it.

476
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,190
我们会唤醒能量帮人治疗
We help heal people by moving blocked energy

477
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,760
让人体验到完整的性愉悦
so they can experience the full potential of sexual pleasure.

478
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,460
原来你们会唤醒能量
So you just move the energy for...

479
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,030
那我回车上拿钱
Hell, yeah. I can... I mean, I got cash in the truck, I think.

480
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,510
别误会
Oh, no, no.

481
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,040
吸引力只需真心诚意
No, the attraction is completely genuine.

482
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,820
好神奇
Ah. I mean...

483
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,220
只要你能感受到那股流动
As long as it's in the flow for you.

484
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,480
我不用啦
No, I'm good.

485
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,790
开玩笑的
Kidding.

486
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,050
我的流动超猛
I'm so in... I'm so in the flow.

487
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,190
赞 我超爱脉轮这种玩意
Great, I love some chakrastuff.

488
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,670
你们在呼麻吗？
Do we smoke that or...

489
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,500
-不是 -不是吗
- No. - No?

490
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,070
这太屌了
This is... This is rad.

491
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,680
你的宝贝狗想要进来吗？
Does your baby wanna come in?

492
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,680
不必 她能自得其乐
Nope, she's good, she's just happy.

493
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,120
她叫得很开心
She's a happy... That's a happy bark.

494
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,420
为我打气
She's just letting me know.

495
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,690
现在我们的心是什么状态？
How are our hearts in this moment?

496
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,260
我的心是…
Mmm, my heart is, um...

497
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,740
圆满的 我找到了新工作
just full and it's like... I mean, I got a new job.

498
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,310
情况好转了
Yeah, uh, things are really looking up.

499
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,010
我感觉很充实
I just feel solid. I feel solid over here,

500
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,060
准备前进
I'm ready to go.

501
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,150
-我还没到那个阶段 -好
- Um, I'm not quite there yet. - Okay.

502
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,890
好的
Okay.

503
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,980
贝拉 也许欢喜佛能转换更多能量
But maybe yab-yum would help move some prana.

504
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,590
我的心正需要能量
This is what my heart needed.

505
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,030
来吧
Yeah, let's go.

506
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,030
感觉很棒吧？
So good, right?

507
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,900
是啊
All right.

508
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,600
我能脱下你的上衣吗？
May I have permission to remove your shirt?

509
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,690
废话 我自己脱
Hell, ye... I'm gonna remove it for you.

510
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,960
还好吗？
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

511
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,790
很闷吗？
Why are you so upset?

512
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,750
可怜鬼
Oh, poor baby.

513
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
我的佛陀啊
Oh, my Buddha.

514
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,710
没事 只是战伤
Oh, no, no. That's, like, some old army shit.

515
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,100
小菜一碟
Don't worry about that.

516
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,240
-你们有疤痕吗？-怎么受伤的？
- You guys... - What's this from?

517
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:06,150
不记得了 但大疤痕是自动步枪
I don't know. That one is... The big one's an AK round.

518
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
你的身体很痛苦 很遗憾
Your body is in so much pain. I'm so sorry, we had no idea.

519
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,030
不要紧
No, no, look, it's fine.

520
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,900
我能脱掉你的上衣吗？
It's fine. Do I have permission to remove your shirt?

521
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,560
我想照顾你的心
'Cause I wanna take care of your heart.

522
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,910
怪不得我们会互相吸引
This is why we were drawn together.

523
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,780
有够混蛋
What an asshole.

524
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,300
怎样？
What?

525
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,180
按住我的手
Place my hand...

526
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,830
让你的痛苦来引导
wherever your pain guides it.

527
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,920
没问题
Yeah, I can do that.

528
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,840
好主意 从这里开始吧
I like this plan. Why don't we start here?

529
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,930
我要放狗了
Let's get you out of here.

530
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,410
不好意思
I'm sorry, um...

531
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,970
抱歉
I'm sorry. I can't, uh,

532
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,020
-狗狗让我分心了 -我去看一下她
- I can't hold this pace. - I'll go check on her,

533
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,760
我去看一下她 好吗
how about that? I'll go check on her. Just...

534
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,760
你待着 保持好能量
You stay right there and you just keep the energy.

535
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,550
嘿！
Hey!

536
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,810
嘿！你在干嘛？
Hey! What are you doing?

537
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,680
解放受虐的动物
Freeing that abused animal.

538
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,950
警告你 扔石头是自找苦吃
You throw that rock and we're about to see who's abused.

539
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:00,820
少在那边用暴力威胁 乡巴佬
Of course you threaten violence, you redneck!

540
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,600
拿石头的人是你
Red... You're the one with the rock, man.

541
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,170
放下走人
Just put it down and walk away.

542
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,600
-我们相安无事 -你最好搞清楚 动物也是人
- I promise you... - Animals are people, too.

543
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,040
-好的 -快放她出来
- Okay... - Let her out now or I will.

544
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,650
-你理解... -都还好吗？
- You understand... - Are you okay?

545
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,960
-怎么回事？-没啥大不了
- What's going on? - Oh, no. It's no big deal.

546
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,830
有个善心人士过来确定狗…
He's just a nice man, came over to make sure the dog...

547
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,220
狗狗回来 走开
Hey! Dog, get back here!

548
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,570
不要
No!

549
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,700
快停 别咬
Stop! Let go! No!

550
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,790
-走开 -听话
- No! - Get it off.

551
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,800
-放开 -快回来
- Heel! - Release!

552
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,670
死笨狗 要死啦
Come on. All right. Come on. Let go!

553
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,060
-够了 你要干嘛？-我要报警了
- Stop it. - I'm callin' the cops.

554
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,410
我超讨厌你的
You... Son of a...

555
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,590
你毁了我3P的大好机会
All right, now, you ruined an epic threesome.

556
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,200
回来
No. Hey! Ah!

557
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
笨狗
Bitch!

558
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,420
你们要去哪？
Where are you guys going?

559
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,510
那我的痛苦呢？
What about... What about my pain?

560
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,430
上车啦
God, just get in the car.

561
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,510
（奥勒冈州感谢您 欢迎再度莅临）

562
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,310
你到底怎么了 狗狗？
Whatever happened to you, dog, huh?

563
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,190
记得莫瑞过世时 莱利逼我们…
Remember when Maretti died?

564
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,410
看15小时的《实习医生》吗？
Riley made us watch, like, 15 hours of Grey's Anatomy.

565
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,360
大家随地坐着
Everybody was sitting around and then you just came around

566
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,710
你把头凑过来蹭每个人
with your fat head, nuzzling everybody,

567
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,540
装可爱 逗大家笑
being all cute, making everybody laugh.

568
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,890
那只可爱狗狗去哪了？
Whatever happened to that dog, huh?

569
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,160
军队容不下累赘
The army has no place for liabilities

570
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,900
你变累赘了
and that's all you are now.

571
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,080
懂吧 这就是你和我的不同
See, you know, that's the difference between you and I, though.

572
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,950
你知道吗
You know that?

573
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,950
脑科医生说我这辈子都会残疾
Those brain doctors said I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.

574
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,780
你爸不同
Not your dad, though.

575
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,690
他没被问话就回去了
Your dad, they just sent back with no questions asked.

576
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,260
他们说我会视力模糊
They said I'd never see straight,

577
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,390
头痛 遇到压力会
I'd have headaches and if I got stressed out,

578
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,830
癫痫发作 死掉什么鬼的
that I'd have seizures and die or some bullshit like that,

579
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,920
但你没看到我癫痫发作变废人吧？
but you don't see some little seizure stopping me, do you?

580
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,970
倒是你老是闯祸
But you, on the other hand, look, if you don't want it,

581
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,880
你无药可救了
ain't no cure for that shit.

582
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,020
像你和我这种咖 不努力就死定了
People like me and you are better off just being all in or all out.

583
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,190
我可不想跟你一样
I just wouldn't want some bullshit-ass injection,

584
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,290
被安乐死
like you're going to have.

585
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,370
反正你没得选
I mean, it's not like you've got a choice in the matter,

586
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,850
也死得不光荣
but it's just not a warrior's death.

587
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,770
要是我会偷一架螺旋桨飞机
I'd probably steal a prop plane

588
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,850
飞向高空
and fly that bitch right into the sun

589
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,380
直到引擎挂掉
till the engines froze out.

590
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,250
然后跳机
And then I'd swan dive right out of the cockpit

591
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,420
像007一样帅
and laugh my ass all the way to Valhalla.

592
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,990
帮帮忙 别发牢骚了
Hey, come on, man, stop the whining.

593
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,260
你听起来像爱哭夭的吉娃娃
You sound like a whiney-ass chihuahua.

594
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,560
糟了 该死
Oh, shit. Okay. Hey, hey, hey!

595
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,650
回来
Hey! No, no, no!

596
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,140
不要 回来
No, no!

597
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,230
不要 过来
Hey, look. No, no, no, no. Come here.

598
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,370
狗狗
Hey, dog!

599
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,590
狗狗 过来 不要
Dog, come here. No!

600
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,590
过来
Come here!

601
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,690
狗狗
Hey, dog!

602
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:44,870
狗狗
Dog!

603
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,630
狗狗
Hey, dog!

604
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,290
过来
Hey, come!

605
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,950
糟了
Oh, shit.

606
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,050
不会吧 狗狗 我们不该进来
No, no, no, no, no. Dog, we're not supposed to be in here.

607
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,830
快走
Let's go.

608
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,050
有人吗？
Hello?

609
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,060
有人在吗？
Hello?

610
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,070
过来
Come!

611
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,240
狗狗？
Dog?

612
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,770
出来
Come on.

613
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
嘿！
Hey!

614
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,330
老天 有没有搞错
Oh, shit. You've gotta be kidding me.

615
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,110
狗狗？
Dog!

616
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,300
嘿 狗狗
Hey, dog!

617
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,210
有人吗？
Hello?

618
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,300
有没有人？
Hello!

619
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,000
大块头
Hey, big fella.

620
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,660
你给我下什么药？镇静剂？
Hey, what did you hit me with, man? Horse tranq?

621
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,180
还真猛
This is pretty good.

622
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,320
该招供了
Time for you to start squealing.

623
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,000
你有看到一只棕色的狗吗？
Hey, have you seen a dog? She's brown,

624
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,410
跑得很快 眼神很凶
she's, like, running around, I don't know, with crazy eyes, huh?

625
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,460
是谁派你来的？
Tell me who you work for.

626
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,110
听着
Okay, look,

627
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,980
你绝对认错人了
I'm obviously not who you think I am.

628
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,640
我知道你是什么来历
I know who the hell you are.

629
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,990
你以为老子没遇过突击部队？
Think you're the first commando they sent up here?

630
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,950
想抢走我的大麻？
Take my strains?

631
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,820
老头 除非你想
Look, old man, unless you're willing to

632
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,170
自找罪受
walk this till the end of the road,

633
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,650
我强烈建议你
I highly suggest you cut me loose

634
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,260
把我松绑让我找回狗
and let me go find my damn dog.

635
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,220
你有5分钟解释
You got five minutes to clear your head,

636
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,180
不然就会步上她的后尘
or you can join her ass.

637
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,620
赞啦
Hell, yeah.

638
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,030
你不知道我的能耐
Who the hell you think you're talking to?

639
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,860
等着看
We'll see about that.

640
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,690
王八蛋
Bitch!

641
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,950
忍无可忍 有够白目
Oh, that is... That's bullshit.

642
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,210
狗狗 快过来
Dog, come here, come here.

643
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,780
狗狗 过来
Now! Come here!

644
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,300
要走了
Come here!

645
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,130
葛斯 他醒了吗？
Gus, is he awake yet?

646
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,740
清醒了 绑在马房里
Wide awake. He's zip-tied in the barn.

647
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,180
绑？天啊
Zip-tied? Oh, my God.

648
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,960
你对他做了什么？
What the hell did you do to him?

649
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,140
我给他下药 骗说杀了他的狗
Some shit. I told him I killed his dog.

650
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,930
你哪里懂审问
Gus, what do you know about interrogation?

651
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,580
你拒绝服兵役耶
You were a conscientious objector.

652
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,410
称赞人家一下嘛
How about a little damn appreciation?

653
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,190
就叫你别哈太多草
I told you not to hit those edibles so hard.

654
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,370
毒枭？你太疑神疑鬼了
Cartel? You paranoid maniac.

655
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,890
跟他说你是
Tell him you're crazy, I'm not...

656
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,940
秀逗没胆的老笨蛋
a scared old fool who needs heavy therapy.

657
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,290
向他道歉
Just tell him you're sorry.

658
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,070
我给他注射镇静剂
I shot him with a tranquilizer.

659
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,940
-我不在乎 -我把他推到粪土
- I don't care what you did. - I pushed him...

660
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,510
别激怒了这小可爱
Now you're making me upset this little nugget.

661
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,430
这毛小孩真乖
This perfect noodle...

662
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,430
听着 我们逃走吧
Listen, let's get the hell out of here.

663
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,600
坐着 我想看看你的小脚掌
'Cause I wanna look at your little, little paw.

664
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,210
你好乖
You're so good.

665
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,520
超乖的
So good.

666
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,960
超乖的
So good.

667
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,130
真是个小可爱
What a little nugget.

668
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,700
-老公 -妈呀 我…
- Honey... - Look, Jesus, I...

669
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,700
闭嘴
Shut up.

670
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,400
坐下
Sit down.

671
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,240
你怎么让她听话的？
How'd you make her eat out of your hand?

672
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,410
我没干嘛
I didn't make her do anything.

673
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,200
只是对她说话而已
I just talked to her.

674
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,380
对了 你尽管教训
By the way, you can do anything you like

675
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,770
我的白痴老公
with my idiot husband.

676
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,810
葛斯 道歉
Gus, apologize.

677
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,770
抱歉 都是我的错
Sorry, dude. My bad, my bad.

678
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,870
她只是个毛小孩
Hmm, see, she's just a noodle.

679
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,530
又很懂事
She just needs some good...

680
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,440
我要碰你的小脚掌了
I'm just going to touch her little, little paw.

681
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,440
她会没事吧？
Is she gonna be okay?

682
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:29,660
我担心她的腿断了
Well, I'm worried she may have broken her foot,

683
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,060
但我会尽力
but I'm gonna try my best.

684
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,190
请问 她叫什么名字？
You need to give, um... What is her name?

685
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,230
露露
Lulu.

686
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,760
露露和我需要空间
Lulu and I some space.

687
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,500
这样吧
So, um, here.

688
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,670
葛斯 帮点忙
Come on. Gus, make yourself useful

689
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,590
给他干净衣服
and get this man some clean clothes

690
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,460
他闻起来一身屎味
because he's really smelling strongly of Boris and his friends.

691
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,900
吃点糖果 交个朋友
So here, take some homemade edibles. Go make friends, okay?

692
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,860
葛斯 快点 别发楞 出去
Guys, come on, stop it. Get outside.

693
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:59,080
听你唬烂 用鞋带就能搞定
You can't tell me that you did this with a damn shoestring.

694
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,610
破坏塑性就简单了
You just gotta compromise the plastic. That's it.

695
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,480
听着 我搞园艺的功夫比绑人强多了
Listen, I'm a lot better at permaculture than I am tying dudes up.

696
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,660
我想知道我那时有多接近⋯
I need to know, man, how close was I to...

697
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,840
-死亡？ -对
- Dying? - Yeah.

698
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,510
挺接近的
Pretty... Pretty close, actually.

699
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,100
我差点用斧头劈开你的头
I almost put an axe in the back of your head.

700
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,970
这大麻棒棒糖真屌
This is... Well done.

701
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,500
是不是？
Yeah, right? Right?

702
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,110
真高兴你是爱狗人士
I'm just glad you love that dog so much.

703
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,330
我不爱狗 那根本不是我的狗
I don't love that dog. It's not even my dog.

704
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,940
加油 用力
Come on, get on your back.

705
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,290
用力 你行的
Get on your back, you can do it.

706
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,680
-加油 -那是谁的狗？
- Come on. - Whose damn dog is it?

707
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,640
看到没？
Look, you see that?

708
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,580
-看到没？-赞啦
- You see this? - Yeah.

709
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,250
他们教狗追踪敌人
This is how they teach them to attract the enemy.

710
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,170
狗在一英里外就能闻到敌人的衣服
They can smell their clothes from, like, a mile off.

711
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,910
这两人死了？
Is this two dead dudes?

712
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,960
对 那里有两个塔利班
Yeah. Those are... That's two Taliban,

713
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,180
大麻农
uh, dope farmers right there.

714
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,740
别惊讶
Oh, don't look all shocked, man.

715
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,140
这是战争 那里可没有独角兽和美女
It's war. It's not all unicorns and rainbow vaginas out there, right?

716
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,100
靠 我好嗨
Yeah, I bet.

717
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,230
对了 为什么这本叫《爱自己》？
So why do they call it I Love Me book?

718
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,020
不知道 但军方要
I don't know. Uh, but in the army,

719
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,760
每个人都有一本
they just, they make us all keep one.

720
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,320
要我们记录每个细节
They make us put every single, last stupid detail in.

721
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,740
{\an8}（露露首次驻外 巴格达战区）

722
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,770
露露的精选 是她最爱的音乐吧？
So, Lulu's greatest hits. This is like...

723
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,680
露露的精选 是她最爱的音乐吧？
Like her music. Like, music she...

724
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,160
差多了 是另一种精选
No, no, no, no, no. It's the other greatest hits, you know.

725
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,300
她执行任务的影片
Like, it's her bodycam footage.

726
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,560
老天 我不想看
Oh, Jesus. It's the... kinda... Yeah, I'll pass.

727
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,950
让我搞清楚
So let me get this right, man.

728
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,780
这只狗立下大功
So, like, the dog did all this, man.

729
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,130
他们却要把她安乐死？
I mean, they're just going to put her down?

730
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,960
这样讲太感伤了
Look, don't get all misty-eyed on me, big man.

731
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,960
话不是这样讲
Like, it's... It's not like that.

732
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,270
那只狗完成了她的使命
That dog did exactly what she was born to do,

733
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,750
也就是活出传奇的人生
and that was to live a legendary life.

734
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,410
她达标了
And she did it.

735
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,800
还有什么？
What the hell is this here?

736
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,240
「亲爱的露露」
"Dear Lulu,

737
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,460
「我无法想象没遇到你会变怎样」
I can hardly imagine life before I knew you.

738
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,490
「你生来是只愤怒的野兽或是…」
Did you come into this world a beast of fury, or were you just..."

739
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,730
等等 那是啥？让我看
What was that? What was that?

740
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,730
看来他写了信
He wrote... It's like written up on top right there.

741
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,600
有几封
There's a couple of 'em,

742
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,040
很像诗或情书
like poems or love letters, or something.

743
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,560
罗利兹几乎不识字
Rodriguez could barely spell.

744
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,220
更不可能作诗
I mean, he definitely can't rhyme.

745
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,130
我懂了
I know what this is. This is...

746
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,610
脑受损时
So when you have a brain injury,

747
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,220
会被送去看脑科医生
you basically get sent to these brain doctors.

748
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:20,490
他们研究你 让你
And then they study you, and they make you draw

749
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,750
又写又画之类的鬼艺术治疗
and write and do all this art therapy bullshit.

750
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,620
没人当一回事
Nobody really takes it serious.

751
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,670
-靠 -哇塞
- Shit! - Oh!

752
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,970
狗狗
Dog!

753
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,620
你痊愈了
You're okay. Hey.

754
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,320
看她跑来跑去
Look at her. She's running around.

755
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,630
只是一小根铁丝
Yeah. There was just a little piece of barbed wire

756
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,460
刺进她的脚掌
just lodged way up in her paw.

757
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,410
我消毒止血了
I sterilized it and stopped the bleeding.

758
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,030
没看过这么强壮的狗
Never seen a dog so strong.

759
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,070
谢谢 感激不尽
Thank you. Thank you so much.

760
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,600
她还跟我产生感应
Also, she did offer me a transmission.

761
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,250
-悟性很高 -感应？
- If you feel called. - Transmission?

762
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:47,820
对 她的命中率很高
Yeah, she bats about 350 on those.

763
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,590
用棒球来比喻
I mean, but, you know, if it was baseball,

764
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,260
她能进名人堂了
it'd be hall of fame numbers.

765
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,000
你们俩肯定是注定的缘分
You two are definitely karmically connected.

766
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,220
她一定是投胎来找你
She must have incarnated to find you.

767
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,140
我看到金字塔
I'm seeing pyramids.

768
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,010
古埃及
Ancient Egypt.

769
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,490
有个小女孩在玩
Now, a young girl, she's playing.

770
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,150
她好快乐
Oh, she's so happy.

771
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,240
露露喜欢小孩吗？
Does Lulu work with kids?

772
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,540
对 她爱死小孩了
Yeah. She loves kids. She loves 'em.

773
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:23,200
-她会猛舔小孩的脸 -不可思议
- And licks their faces right off. - Unbelievable.

774
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,640
那可能是…
I think it might be

775
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
你女儿
your daughter.

776
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,650
她有个中性的名字？
Does she have a boy's name?

777
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,690
-中性的名字？-珊米
- A boy's name? - Uh, Sam.

778
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,740
我女儿怎么了？
Um, what about my daughter?

779
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,130
露露让我连结到她
Well, Lulu, she's bringing her into my awareness.

780
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,140
她几岁了？
How old is she?

781
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,090
三岁
Uh, three.

782
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,530
专心在狗身上就好
Let's... Let's just keep it about the dog.

783
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,050
好
Okay.

784
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:57,060
我感到又冷又硬
I'm feeling cold. Hard, yes.

785
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,280
她渴望柔软的床
She's yearning for soft. Yes, a bed.

786
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,550
高级的床垫
A luxury mattress.

787
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,900
她说她没睡过像样的床
She says she's never slept in a nice bed before.

788
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,330
可以吗？
She asks if it's okay.

789
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,860
-她在问我？-好呀
- She's asking me that? - Mmm.

790
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,900
当然了
Okay, yeah, sure.

791
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,780
我好热 口干舌燥
Now I'm getting hot... Tongue... Taste.

792
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,780
她想吃印度菜？
Indian food she wants?

793
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,130
你别闹了
Are you kidding me?

794
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,090
-葛斯 -丑三
- Gus. - Strike three.

795
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,180
葛斯 你干嘛吐槽我？
Gus, why do you undermine me?

796
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,700
狗才不想吃印度菜
The damn dog don't want Indian food.

797
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,540
幸好我们没有误杀好人
I'm so happy we didn't have to kill those nice people.

798
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,240
否则我们
But I'm just saying, if we did,

799
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,150
肯定得挖超大的洞
you were definitely digging the bigger hole

800
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,020
葛斯超大只的
'cause Gus was massive.

801
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,500
对了 下次嗅到大麻别溜掉
And by the way, the next time you smell weed,

802
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,290
通知我 我们可以一起嗨
don't run away, just let me know, and we can go get it together.

803
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,290
不可以 不行
Hey, hey, hey! No, no!

00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,390
这是我的独角兽
This is my unicorn.

810
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,010
不要 够了
No, no, no, no, no. Stop!

811
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,760
好啦 过来 小巴 过来 管好你的狗
Stop it. Okay, all right, come on, come on. Let's go.

812
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,850
走啦 抱歉
Let's go. Sorry, guys.

813
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,810
我是妮基 请留言
Hey, it's Niki. Leave a message.

814
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,210
你看什么？
What are you looking at?

815
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,220
少在那边哭
What you whining for?

816
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,390
都怪你我们才没处去
You're the whole reason we're up here.

817
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,440
苦中作乐吧
Get comfy.

818
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,700
今晚睡这里
That's where you're sleeping tonight.

819
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,620
想念你的狗笼？
You're missing your cage?

820
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,850
看 那里是恶魔岛
Look. It's Alcatraz, it's right there.

821
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,630
我们能参观一下
Just take a little tour.

822
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,460
不然把你丢在那里好了
You know, possibly just leave you there.

823
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,960
你只剩三天活在地球上
You only got about three more days left on this green Earth,

824
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,420
及时行乐 以免为时已晚
so you better speak now or forever hold your peace.

825
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,170
听着 想睡舒服床垫又不丢脸
Hey, look, ain't no shame in wanting a big, comfy mattress, okay?

826
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,690
我懂
Look, I get it. I get it.

827
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,300
我的背开过三次刀
I've had three back operations, so I get it.

828
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,690
舒服才是王道 但现实很残酷
Comfort is king. But the facts are this...

829
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,480
我们俩像流浪汉 高级饭店一定
They ain't letting two rock eaters like me and you

830
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,960
不让我们进去
in some bougie-ass hotel.

831
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,480
我也不想住三流旅馆
And I ain't about that Holiday Inn life.

832
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,050
但我有个点子
But I got an idea.

833
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:40,350
想要睡高档床
If you want that bed,

834
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,840
就得玩很大
we gotta go big, or we gotta go home.

835
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,840
赞成吧？
Are you with me?

836
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,760

848
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,620
我来看看
Oh, well, let me check on that.

849
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,060
她身上那是紫心勋章？
Oh, is that a purple heart? Was she wounded?

850
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,200

852
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,770
进来时我就说吧
What did I say? Right when we walked in,

853
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,340
从古至今
I said that, "Never in history

854
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,990
只要是瞎掉的老兵 牵着英雄狗
has a blind veteran and his hero dog

855
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,340
进饭店 就能免费住
walked into a hotel and not gotten a free room."

856
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,520
为什么我会这样说？
And why did I say that?

857
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,080
为什么会这样？
Why did I say that happens every time?

858
00:46:58,130 --> 00:46:59,690
没错
Oh, you're right.

859
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,780
自由 所以才会成功
Freedom. That is why that happens.

860
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,390
谁是天才？
Who's a genius?

861

Why are you... Are you hot?

863
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,360

966
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,740
我的天 慢慢来
Oh my god, take your time, take your time.

967
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,920
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

968
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,350
去找医生
Somebody get a doctor.

969
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,880
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

970
00:52:59,970 --> 00:53:01,970
不行
No!

971
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,800
你还好吗？冷静点
You all right? Take it easy, take it easy.

972
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,890
没事了 快起来
Okay. Here we go, here we go.

973
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,890
天哪 我看得见了
Oh, my God, I can... I can see.

974
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:16,200
我看见了 各位 我看见了
I can see. Guys, I can see!

975
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,170
你装成盲人
So you were impersonating a blind man

976
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:30,130
只是为了训练导盲犬？
as part of a seeing eye dog training exercise?

977
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:32,040
没错
Yep, that's right.

978
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:35,570
突然 你没料到
When suddenly, uh, unbeknownst to you,

979
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,220
你的狗挣脱了
um, your dog broke free from your grasp,

980
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,090
冲向大厅
sprinted the entire length of the lobby

981
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,360
-撞倒受害者 -对
- and muzzle struck the victim? - Correct.

982
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,970
你之前没看过这只狗…
And you've never seen this dog exhibit

983
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,750
表现出任何侵略举动？
any type of aggressive behavior before this?

984
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,710
对 她通常跟人很亲
Never. Never. She usually... She loves people.

985
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,190
她不会伤人 我想不通
It's out of her character. I really don't understand it.

986
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,020
-我也很震惊 -好
- Man, honestly, I'm in shock. - Uh-huh.

987
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,420
你还要补充什么吗？
Is there anything else you want to add?

988
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,720
那个人还好吧？
How is the guy? Is he all right?

989
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,160
-对 -他看起来没事
- Yeah. - He seemed okay.

990
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,030
早上我们会联络阿法德医生
Well, we're gonna be contacting Dr. Al-Farid in the morning.

991
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:05,380
要是他想提告 我们就会接管
He wants to press charges. We'll take it from there.

992
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,250
在那之前你继续蹲牢房
Until then, you just sit tight.

993
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,170
那只狗还好吗？
Cool, and the dog? Dog's okay?

994
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,000
你要联系动物管制队
We're gonna have to check with animal control on that one.

995
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,390
我什么时候能接走她？
Okay. So when do I get her back?

996
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,260
交保时？
Do I have to post bail or whatever?

997
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,050
交保？老兄 现在是周五晚上
Post bail? Buddy, it is Friday night.

998
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,530
法官周一早上才会进来
Judge is not back until Monday A.M.

999
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,230
我必须关住所有
And I am required to keep all suspects

1000
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,970
仇恨犯罪的嫌犯
in possible hate crimes in my custody.

1001
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,620
仇恨犯罪？
Hate crime?

1002
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,360
少烦我 去问市政厅
Now, don't start with me. Take it to City Hall.

1003
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:32,060
这和仇恨犯罪有什么关系？等一下
Who said anything about a hate crime? Wait, wait, wait.

1004
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,890
等一下 让我...
Hold on a second. Okay. All right. Let me... Let me...

1005
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:34,890
我就直说了
Let me level with you, man.

1006
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,590
我是陆军游骑兵
Okay? I was an Army Ranger.

1007
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,020
狗的主人是我过世的战友
That dog's handler was my buddy, and he passed.

1008
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,030
我周日要把她带去亚利桑那州参加葬礼
I got to take her down to his funeral in Arizona on Sunday.

1009
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,990
金星勋章的家属就靠我送她过去了
I got a Gold Star family that's just depending on me to get her there.

1010
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,990
好吗 周一早上我保证会回来
All right? Now I'll be back here first thing Monday morning. I promise.

1011
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,430
但今晚我得送她过去
I just... I got to get her and I got to go tonight.

1012
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,260
你是陆军游骑兵？
You were an Army Ranger?

1013
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,000
对
Yeah.

1014
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,310
干嘛不早说？
Why the hell didn't you say so?

1015
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:05,350
-抱歉 -何必浪费我
- I'm sorry. - Instead of puttin' me through

1016
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,490
20分钟讲鬼话？
20 minutes of that Ray Charles bullshit, huh?

1017
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:09,310
我是第202旅
I was in the 202nd.

1018
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,450
老兄 跟你讲喔
Hey, buddy, I gotta tell you something.

1019
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:11,930
我就直说了
And I gotta level with you.

1020
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:13,490
你进入酒店大厅
You going into that hotel lobby, huh,

1021
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,490
戴墨镜牵着狗
with that damn cane and those glasses, man.

1022
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,370
你们陆军游骑兵有够带种
You Army Rangers, you've got balls of steel.

1023
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,980
-不 那很蠢 -我是铁粉 没骗你
- No. It was stupid. - I'm a huge fan, seriously.

1024
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,240
借问一下 你老实说
Hey, I gotta ask you something, on the real, on the real.

1025
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,850
是你教唆那疯狗去咬中东佬吧？
You sent that little beast for that raghead, didn't ya?

1026
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,110
啥？
What? Huh?

1027
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,990
报复他们算计我们 对吧？
Get a little payback for what they took from us, right?

1028
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,600
-对吧？-没有
- Right? - No. I... No,

1029
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,470
-肯定没有 -少来
- definitely, I didn't do that. - Come on. Don't worry, man.

1030
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,300
我口风很紧 我不会说出去
My lips are sealed. I'm not gonna say nothing.

1031
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,750
我们宪兵很会保守秘密
And us 31 Alphas, we keep it tight. You know?

1032
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,170
宪兵？
Alpha 31s?

1033
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,610
我们会罩你们这些狠角色
Yeah, we looked out for you badasses real good.

1034
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,090
守住大门 对吧？
Out by the front gate, right?

1035
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:44,130
原来你是宪兵
Oh, you were an MP.

1036
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,480
-正解 -果然
- Damn right. - Right.

1037
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,960
你在暗示什么？
What are you implying?

1038
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,050
我没暗示什么
Oh, no, no, I'm not implying anything.

1039
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:55,360
你们宪兵的工作很辛苦
No, I mean, we... You MPs, man, you guys got a hard job.

1040
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,190
所以我才睡得安心
I never slept better knowing that you guys

1041
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:00,500
多亏你们守在警卫室 力挺我们
were out there at the guardhouse, on the wall, watching over us.

1042
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,500
我欣赏你 兄弟
Yeah, I appreciate that, brother.

1043
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,110
你不像我遇过的
Yeah, I appreciate it too that you're not like

1044
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,240
其他游骑兵
all those other Army Rangers that I've met.

1045
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,760
留着像摩西
You know, with the long beards

1046
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:09,940
一样的山羊胡
flowing in the wind, like they were Moses?

1047
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,770
按喇叭通过大门口 不亮证件
The car going right by the front gate, not showin' an ID,

1048
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,250
对我们比中指 「感谢你为国效力」
flipping us off, "Thank you for your service."

1049
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,510
你不是这种烂人吧？
Yeah, you're not one of those guys, are you?

1050
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,950
我没干过这种事
No, I... No, no, no.

1051
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,000
肯定没有
No, I definitely...

1052
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,560
信你一回 知道我还相信什么？
You know what? I buy that. You know what else I buy?

1053
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,390
白人士兵会命令狗攻击回教医生
White military guy sics his dog on a Muslim doctor

1054
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,920
为美国蓝领阶级争口气
in the heart of woke-ing class America.

1055
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,750
饶了我吧 让我带狗走人
Man, don't do this. Don't do this. Just let me get my dog and go.

1056
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,100
狗又是你的啰
Oh, now it's your dog!

1057
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,360
一夜好眠 贱人
Sleep tight, bitch.

1058
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,110
布里格
Briggs?

1059
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,500
起床啦 要列队指认了
Rise and shine. Line-up time.

1060
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,120
转向左边
Step to the left.

1061
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,430
还要指认？不就是我
Really? A line-up? It's like... It's me, right?

1062
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,340
所有人转向右边
Everybody, step to your right.

1063
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,690
这在干嘛？你们有养狗吗？
What are we doing? Did you guys even have dogs?

1064
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,910
他看起来像猫奴
He seems like a cat guy.

1065
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,570
-三号 安静 -不是我会是谁？
- Quiet, number three. - We all know it was me, right?

1066
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:14,310
对 是他
Yes, it was him.

1067
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,140
正面
Face forward.

1068
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:18,360
是他
It's him.

1069
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,050
了解 谢谢你
I got it. Thank you, sir.

1070
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,530
听我说句话
Can I... Can I just, like... You know what?

1071
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,230
这样吧 我供认好吗？
I'm just gonna confess. How about that?

1072
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,100
三号 后退
Step back, number three.

1073
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,840
听我说 我供认好不好？
No, I'm sorry. Can I confess? Is that, like, a thing?

1074
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:29,320
我要吃午餐耶
Man, I've got lunch.

1075
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,850
都是我的错
It was my fault. I don't...

1076
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:35,200
我的狗只是受训完成使命
Look, my dog, she was just doing what she was trained to do.

1077
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,240
很遗憾她的训练
And unfortunately, she was trained

1078
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,200
就是攻击长得像阿法德医生的人
to attack guys that look like Dr. Al-Farid.

1079
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,640
够了 三号
All right, that's enough, number three.

1080
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,340
让他说 我想听
Wait, let him speak. I want to hear it.

1081
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,470
她服役7年 8次派驻
She served seven years, eight deployments,

1082
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:49,210
她救过无数的生命
but she did save more people than you can count.

1083
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:51,170
我没有种族歧视
I'm not some racist piece of shit,

1084
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,830
但我会全盘招供
but I'll confess to whatever it is that you want me to

1085
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,480
一切听你们的
or do whatever you want me to,

1086
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,610
只要有人保证
as long as someone promises me

1087
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,180
周日把她送去参加葬礼
that they will get her to that funeral this Sunday.

1088
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:01,010
一言为定？
Is that a deal that I can make?

1089
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,840
这人真有事
Give me a break.

1090
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,530
把他带过来
All right. Take him out of here.

1091
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,360
-真假？不回应？-五分钟后下一组
- Really? Nothing. - Next group in five.

1092
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,100
就这样？
That's it?

1093
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,370
稍候 三号
Hold on, number three.

1094
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,980
你装成盲人
So you impersonated a blind man

1095
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,420
只是为了免费住酒店？
just to get a free hotel room?

1096
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,940
是啊 确实
Uh, yeah, yeah, I did.

1097
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,730
有个灵媒说我的狗她想...
Um, there was a psychic and she said that she wanted...

1098
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:30,650
我的狗想睡舒服的床垫
My dog wanted a mat... Like, a comfy mattress.

1099
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:31,990
别管了
And some... Never mind.

1100
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,210
真是瞎扯
It's... It's insane.

1101
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,830
是很瞎
It is insane.

1102
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,220
就我来看 你也很瞎
And if you want my non-clinical opinion, so are you.

1103
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,220
合情合理
Yeah, that's... That's fair.

1104
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:48,450
但我想过更瞎的是
But the more I sit with it, it's even more insane to

1105
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,410
我放下工作 特地从波士顿飞回来
leave my practice and fly back from Boston

1106
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:54,930
只为起诉想把狗送去葬礼的老兵
just to prosecute a veteran trying to get his dog to a funeral.

1107
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,540
只要答应我
Just promise, when it's all done,

1108
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,070
事成后你会去看心理医生
you'll seek professional help.

1109
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,640
遵命
I, uh... Yes, sir.

1110
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,340
-慢走不送 -慢走
- Salaam. - Salaam.

1111
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,180
还好吗 狗狗？
Hey, what's up, dog?

1112
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,310
你好吗？
What's up? How're you doing?

1113
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,480
看到你竟然会这么开心
Never thought I'd be this excited to see you.

1114
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,270
她一直都这么喘吗？
Has she always panted so much?

1115
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,710
对 她可能跟我一样怕热
Yeah, she runs... She runs hot, I guess, like me.

1116
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,450
她不是怕热
She's not hot.

1117
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,060
是创伤后的焦虑
That's anxiety. It comes from trauma.

1118
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,410
我同事摸她耳朵
You know, she tried to bite my colleague

1119
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,410
就差点被咬
when he lightly touched her on the ears.

1120
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,720
好好照顾她或找个尽责的主人
Either take responsibility for her or find someone who will.

1121
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,330
好 谢谢
Okay, thank you.

1122
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,940
准备走人了？
You're ready to get out of here? Huh?

1123
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,560
你的家当 快走
Your personal effects. Dismissed.

1124
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:59,430
从我面前滚蛋
As in, get out of my face.

1125
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:01,950
听到没？快滚出他面前
Did you hear the nice man? We should get out of his face.

1126
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,300
来吧
Come on.

1127
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,180
对了 警官
Oh, and, officer,

1128
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,570
感谢你为国效力 贱人
thank you for your service, bitch.

1129
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,320
走吧
Come on.

1130
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,320
给我滚
Yeah, keep walking.

1131
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,060
你看屁
What are you looking at?

1132
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,240
知道何时跟进

1137
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,330
你满上相的
You're a very photogenic dog, you know that?

1138
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,070
你是真英雄
You look like a hero.

1139
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,820
你怎么没说你有个哥哥？
Why didn't you tell me you had a brother?

1140
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,340
他就住在洛杉矶
And he lives in Los Angeles.

1141
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,780
我和你有个共同点
We got something in common, me and you.

1142
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,350
我在那座鬼城也有家人
I got family in that godforsaken city.

1143
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:51,390
我们来做个约定
You know what? I'll make you a deal.

1144
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,010
路上你不再搞怪
You don't do anything all psychotic on this trip,

1145
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,400
时间也来得及 也许我们就去看他
and we make good time, we can go see him.

1146
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,450
说定了？握手？
Maybe, okay? Is that a deal? Shake?

1147
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,540
你在握手 居然
Shake. You got it.

1148
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,410
成交
Okay, deal.

1149
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,240
老天 算了
Jesus Christ. All right.

1150
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,730
走吧 上去

好 是时候了
Okay, game time.

1156
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,500
如果我进去待太久
Look, if I'm spending too long in there,

1157
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:58,070
你就放声哭
you have full permission to go psychotic,

1158
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,330
我会出来
like usual, and I'll come out.

1159
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,430
要不要穿外套？好像太假掰了
Jacket or no jacket? I feel like the jacket's too much.

1160
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:06,560
我干嘛跟你讨论？
What am I doing, talking to you?

1161
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:28,060
妈咪 「好奇猴乔治」结束了
Mommy, Curious George turned off.

1162
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,540
宝贝
Okay, sweetie.

1163
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:30,840
-等我过去 -好
- I'll be right there, okay? - Mmm-hmm.

1164
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,940
妈咪 是谁？
Mommy, who's there?

1165
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,160
只是妈咪的朋友
Uh, it's just one of Mommy's friends.

1166
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,900
去我的房间
Go to my room,

1167
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:49,250
待会我会准备好意大利面
I'll bring your pasta in a few minutes, okay?

1168
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,140
好吧 你想要？给你
Well, you want it? You got it.

1169
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,360
狗狗 我找过家人了 换你
Okay, dog, I tried my family, let's try yours.

1170
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,550
怎样？
What?

1171
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:14,680
你哥不在的话我们就走了
Look, if your brother ain't here,

1172
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,160
别急 别急
we are definitely not waiting.

1173
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:18,340
喔 喔 别
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no.

1174
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:19,430
-努努 -诺亚
- Nuke! - Hey, Noah.

1175
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,300
抱歉不请自来
I'm sorry to barge in, man.

1176
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,000
露露 是你吗？
Lulu, is that you?

1177
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,650
我是莱利的战友
I'm one of Riley's old teammates,

1178
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:26,740
我想让她见见她哥
and I figured, you know, I'd let her see her brother.

1179
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,180
别摸她的耳朵
Watch her...

1180
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:29,830
我懂
I know, I know.

1181
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,750
她的耳朵很敏感 是吧 妹子？
She's sensitive on the ears, aren't you, girl?

1182
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:35,440
乖狗狗 好耶
Good girl. Hey. Oh, yeah.

1183
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:37,660
你还会爱的抱抱？认真？
You give hugs now, really?

1184
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,750
露露是抱抱高手呢
Oh, yeah. Lulu gives the best hugs.

1185
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,490
你们没抱过？
You've never had a Lulu hug?

1186
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,410
我们没那么娘
No, we don't... We don't... We don't exactly hug.

1187
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:45,800
你衣服穿中号还大号？
You a medium or a large?

1188
01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:48,170
你怕了？
Are you bitching out on me?

1189
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,090
怕个屁
No, I'm not bitching out on you.

1190
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:50,760
她这三天巴不得咬死我
She's been wanting to kill me for three days.

1191
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,590
来吧 放马过来
Come on, let's go. Give it to me, come on, let's go.

1192
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,210
保持冷静 玩个痛快 很好玩的
Stay calm. You're having fun. This is fun.

1193
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,600
好玩？看到没
Oh, having fun? Just look at her.

1194
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,990
她想杀了我
She wants to murder me.

1195
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,300
-这才不好玩 -放轻松
-This isn't fun. -Relax.

1196
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,820
-放轻松 -放马过来
- Relax. - Come on, come on.

1197
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,470
放马过来 我们来玩玩
Come on, we'll make it fun.

1198
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,300
好玩耶 来咬我啊
It's fun. Take a little piece.

1199
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:10,910
你很想吧 你一定很想咬我
Take a little piece. I know you like it. I know you want it.

1200
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:14,050
再说一次为什么要她咬？
Remind me again why we want her to bite.

1201
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:17,050
她不懂战争 只是当做工作
She doesn't know what war is. For her, it's just work.

1202
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,180
你要让她知道
You've got to show her that work can be fun again,

1203
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:21,010
工作很好玩
nothing bad is going to happen, okay?

1204
01:05:21,060 --> 01:05:22,620
这样你们才会有默契
That's how you make a bond.

1205
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:24,100
我们不需要默契
I don't need to make a bond, okay?

1206
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,840
怎样？我不够好玩？
I just... What, am I not fun enough for you?

1207
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,970
来啊
Come on.

1208
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,190
给他玩下去 记得手举高一点
Just hold your arm up a bit higher.

1209
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:31,070
举高了 快来咬
It's up, man. Take it. Come on, just get it.

1210
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,940
-干得好 努努 -干得好
- Good boy, Nuke. Good boy! - Good boy.

1211
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,680
教他这是用来磨牙
Let him know this is love, your chew toy,

1212
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,850
只是玩玩
this is fun.

1213
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,770
干得好 努努 干得好
Good boy, Nuke. Good boy.

1214
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:43,120
你是说努努原本跟露露一样火爆？
So you're telling me that Nuke was just as messed up as Lulu.

1215
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:45,560
我花半年每天训练他
I'd been working every day for six months

1216
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:48,470
然后说服军方让我收养他
before I convinced the army to let me adopt him out.

1217
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,390
当初我不敢确定
Thought we'd never get there.

1218
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,830
现在我还敢让他当保姆
Now we trust Nuke to babysit.

1219
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,130
孩子们 吃汉堡
Kids, burgers!

1220
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:54,960
糟糕
Shit.

1221
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,660
爹地 这掉到地上了？
Daddy, was this on the ground?

1222
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:05,100
-没啦 -你说谎 我看到了
- No. - You're lying. I saw it fall.

1223
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,360
宝贝 我接住了
Baby, I dropped it into my hand, okay?

1224
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,280
不要紧啦
It's fine. You're fine.

1225
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:12,930
周六还得遛小孩
Saturdays.

1226
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,110
我连狗都顾不好
I can barely take care of the dogs.

1227
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,370
你真是太神了
I don't know how you're doing all this.

1228
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:21,720
我懂 我差点顾不了努努
Yeah, I get it. Nuke was about all I could handle,

1229
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,900
但他不再苦撑时
but when he stopped struggling,

1230
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,690
我也干脆不再苦撑了
that's when I realized maybe I could stop struggling too, you know?

1231
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,690
你想莱利治得好露露吗？
Do you think Riley could've fixed Lulu?

1232
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:34,520
让她继续参战绝对治不好
Not by keeping her in the fight, no.

1233
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,260
你要懂得什么时候要重生 不然就等死
You gotta know when to hang 'em up or check out, I guess.

1234
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,400
有时游骑兵就爱寻死
Well, sometimes Rangers just find a way to die, man.

1235
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,180
帮我抱抱莱利的母亲
Give Riley's mom a big hug.

1236
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,750
他们不常说话 但他很爱她
They didn't talk much, I know, but she meant a lot to him.

1237
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,360
没问题 兄弟
Yeah, I will, man.

1238
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:58,110
拜托 老天 该死 真是够啰
Oh, come on. No! Shit! You gotta be kidding me.

1239
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,760
这一带的邻居还真友善
No, it's a real nice neighborhood you got here, man.

1240
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,730
他们偷光我的东西 连莱利的背包
They got all my shit. They got Riley's shit.

1241
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:07,380
和我的药都干走
They got my meds.

1242
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:09,030
好样的
Well, that's good.

1243
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,340
至少他父母还有狗牌
At least I can give his parents his dog tags.

1244
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,770
好啊
Oh, good.

1245
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,690
他们留下你的独角兽
They left your unicorn.

1246
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:16,130
露露 露露
Lulu, Lulu, here.

1247

Seek.

01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:21,650
露露 快去找
Yeah, Lulu, go, seek.

1252
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,410
很好 很好
Oh, yeah. There we go. There we go.

Okay, okay. Come on, Nuke.

努努 去找
Come, Nuke. Nuke. Seek.

1256
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:43,810
我们应该找对方向了
I guess we're going in the right direction.

1257
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,760
去找 去找

1259
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,380
老婆 喂？
Yes, baby, yes.

1260
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:50,420
水烧滚了
Put the water on, I'm sure it's boiling.

1261
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:52,340
对 青酱好了
Yes, pesto is fine.

1262
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,250
我只是带同事去晃晃
We're... I'm just showing my buddy the Boardwalk.

1263
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,430
抱歉 蒂芬妮 我想去看看码头
Sorry, Tiffany, I just wanted to see the piers.

1264
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:58,390
我们很快回来
Yes, okay. We'll be back soon, okay?

1265
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:59,430
去找
Seek.

1269
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:13,230
抓紧她 去找
Just don't let her go. Seek, Nuke.

1270
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,360
去找
Seek.

1271
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,190
去找 努努
Seek, Nuke.

1272
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,460
去找...
Seek, seek, seek.

1273
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,590

Find it, Nuke. Find it.

1274
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:34,210
去找
Seek.

1275
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,600
给我闭嘴
Joe! Shut the hell up.

1276
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,990
去找 去找
Seek, seek.

1277
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,820
去找 去找
Seek. Seek.

1278
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:51,920
去找 继续 去找
Seek. Seek.

1279
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,050
她找到了
Yeah, yeah, she found it, she found it.

1280
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:56,840
干得好 努努
Good boy, Nuke.

1281
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,490
没错
Yeah, this is it.

1282
01:08:58,530 --> 01:09:01,880
是我的东西 散了满地
Yeah, yeah, it's my shit. It's just everywhere.

1283
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:04,410
这些毒虫可能正在吸我的头痛药
This crackhead's probably snorting my migraine meds right now.

1284
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,110
莱利的东西都在
Yeah, most of Riley's shit's here.

1285
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:10,280
她的本子也在
Her book's here.

1286
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:14,810
搞什么鬼？这些是我的
Hey, what is this shit, man? This is private property.

1287
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,510
-是吗？那是你的？ -对
- Oh, is it? That's yours? - Yeah.

1288
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,420
-杰克森 走吧 -你叫做罗利兹？
- All right, Jackson, let's go. - Your name's Rodriguez?

1289
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:20,510
我是美军老兵
Man, I'm a United States army veteran, man.

1290
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,300
快脱掉
Yeah? Take it off right now.

1291
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,780
-我才不脱 -你是哪一营的？
- I ain't taking off shit. - What battalion were you in?

1292
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,820
那是机密
That's classified.

1293
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,700
警告你 给我脱掉
Get it off! Get it off!

1294
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:34,660
滚开 搞屁
Oh, goddamn, man.

1295
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,660
可恶 我为国效力却得到这种回报
Hey, I serve my country, and this is the thanks I get?

1296
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,970
我是战争英雄耶
I'm a war hero!

1297
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,360
你没有药行吗？
You're gonna be all good without those meds?

1298
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,670
我真该让她吃掉那个死小偷
I should have just let her eat that stolen valor piece of shit.

1299
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,890
贫民窟的老兵是真是假很难说
You never know in places like that who served.

1300
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,720
五年前你可能
And if you were here five years ago,

1301
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,590
也会在码头下抓到我
you could have caught my ass under that pier,

1302
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,980
情况也许更糟
and that would have been the best-case scenario.

1303
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:59,290
但我们不会让自己沦落成这样
Yeah, but I didn't. 'Cause that bullshit ain't us.

1304
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:00,330
是吗？
Yeah?

1305
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,340
那莱利呢？
What about Riley?

1306
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,030
莱利怎样？
What about Riley?

1307
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,170
他下床前要先吞三颗止痛剂
I mean, the dude couldn't get out of bed without popping three percs.

1308
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:08,910
那是冠军早餐
Well, that's just the breakfast of champions,

1309
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,690
他就是冠军
and he was a champion.

1310
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,170
我数不清他打给我多少次
I can't tell you how many times he called me up,

1311
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:16,520
我们喝茫闲聊我们想要的死法
we'd get shitfaced talking about how we were gonna check out.

1312
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:20,830
听着 待在军队难免不好受
Look, man, we all deal with shit to stay in the game, okay?

1313
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,230
所以就要永远留下？
So we're supposed to stay in it forever?

1314
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,930
他说过要飚车飞进大峡谷
He used to talk about driving off the Grand Canyon at top speed,

1315
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:29,410
结果他撞到树
but he drove himself into a tree instead.

1316
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:35,850
我劝他说出来
I tried to get him to talk.

1317
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:38,720
说出来？找治疗师说？
Talk, like what, to a therapist?

1318
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,330
真是馊主意
That was a great idea.

1319
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,120
不 找其他过来人说
No, to other guys who have gone through it,

1320
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,160
甚至对上帝说也好
or even just to God.

1321
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,550
上帝？
God?

1322
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,770
你根本不懂莱利
Okay, you didn't know shit about Riley, all right?

1323
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,780
听着 我不是耍白烂
Look, by God, I mean anything.

1324
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,250
也能跟石头或鞋子说
Could be a rock, could be a shoe,

1325
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,210
或是跟理发师说
could be his damn barber.

1326
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:56,000
但我们迟早要找个对象说出来
But we all got to pick something at some point.

1327
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,650
这个嘛
Well...

1328
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,880
他没有说 也不会说
he didn't, and he won't.

1329
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:07,840
所以就没啥好说了
So ain't no use bitching about it.

1330
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,060
我们受训要挺身捍卫这个世界
You know, we trained to put the whole world on our back.

1331
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,750
但到头来
At the end of the day,

1332
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,230
最困难的是向朋友寻求帮助
the hardest thing was knocking on a friend's door.

1333
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,150
掰 露露
Bye, Lulu.

1334
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,150
帮我向你爹地问好
Say hi to your daddy for me.

1335
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,460
我会为你们祈祷
I'll be praying for you guys.

1336
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,980
我们会很好的
We're gonna be just fine.

1337
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:27,810
过来
Come here.

1338
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:28,990
孩子们
Hello, guys.

1339
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,590
{\an8}（诺加利斯 80公里）

1340
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,160
希望明天你准备好了
I hope you're ready for this tomorrow,

1341
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,250
你知道他们想看到什么吗？
because you know what they want, right?

1342
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:18,730
他们想看见悲伤的战犬
They want the hero war dog all sad and stoic,

1343
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,300
想念她的战争英雄老爹
just missing her hero war daddy.

1344
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,520
他们不想看见什么？
What they definitely don't want...

1345
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:27,660
他们可不乐见…
They definitely don't want you trying to eat everybody

1346
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,050
护旗队一鸣枪就被你咬
as soon as the color guard starts firing their salute.

1347
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:36,490
但他们并不了解你
Now, they... They don't know you. That's for damn sure.

1348
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,060
他们不明白当上英雄的代价
They don't know what it takes to be a hero.

1349
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,060
还有你成为英雄狗的经历
The things you've done to be a hero dog.

1350
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:46,540
要是他们知道真相
If they knew the truth,

1351
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,640
包准会吓到挫屎
it would scare the living shit out of them.

1352
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,160
我退役时
You know, when I got out,

1353
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:00,300
你爹地给我一片木板
your daddy gave me this shitty piece of plywood

1354
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:02,470
上面刻着「谢谢」两字
with the word "Thanks" carved in it.

1355
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:07,130
似乎多说无益了
It's like, what else do you say to somebody

1356
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,870
大家都曾一起出生入死
that you experience what we experienced together?

1357
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:13,750
你有在听吗？
You even listening to me?

1358
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,660
我竟然跟狗说心事
Just talking to a dog.

1359
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,190
搞什么？
What is that?

1360
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,360
没这么衰吧
No. No, no.

1361
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,110
帮帮忙
No, no. Come on.

1362
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,500
别在这时候出包
Don't you do this to me now.

1363
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,550
糟糕
No.

1364
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,690
该死
Okay...

1365
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,300
当然没讯号
Of course, there's no service.

1366
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,430
怎么会有讯号
Why would we have service?

1367
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,340
别乱跑
Hey, hey, hey.

1368
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:27,860
有人吗？

明早会如期送她过去
Yep. Still on schedule to drop her off

1517
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,880
我会打给安全中心
First thing in the A.M.

1518

还有一件事
Oh, uh, one more thing.

1522
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,930
听着 她有进步
Look, she's... She's doing a lot better.

1523
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,150
这只狗不一样了
I mean, she's a completely different dog now.

1524
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:50,540
也许我们能跟基地人员
I don't know, maybe there's someone on base

1525
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:52,290
说些好话
that one of us could talk to.

1526
01:25:52,330 --> 01:25:54,460
布里格 那由不得我们
Briggs, you know that's not up to us.

1527
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,160
-就别管了 -好吧

-证件 先生 -好

1558

证件过期 早该作废了
Your army ID has expired.

1559
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,950
知道啦 我只是把狗送来
You're required by law to dispose... Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you.

1560
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:56,610
要交给利瓦伊兹下士
Uh, I'm just dropping off the dog, man, uh, to a Corporal Levitz.

1561
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:58,430
利瓦伊兹
Hey, Levitz!

1562
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:00,700
帮个忙 车停旁边
Do me a favor, park right here.

1563
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:01,520
好
Yeah.

1564
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:16,100
老兄 你们游骑兵真是办事不力
Shit, man. You Rangers ever hear of callin'?

1565
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:18,410
我在大太阳底下等了一小时
I've been out here cooking my ass off for an hour.

1566
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:20,280
还好吧
It could be worse.

1567
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:23,070
等一下又不会死人
You could be actually working.

1568
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:24,720
听说她很凶暴
All right, man. I hear she's a real killer,

1569
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,070
一定要把她的嘴套戴好
so just make sure you muzzle her up good, okay?

1570
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,110
好
Yeah.

1571
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,290
没事
Don't worry.

1572
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:31,900
她不会惹麻烦的
She ain't gonna be a problem.

1573
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,430
是吧？
Are you, girl?

1574
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:37,910
最后一次戴好吗？最后一次
Last time, okay? Last time.

1575
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:39,690
再戴一次就好
Just gonna put it on one more time.

1576
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,090
兄弟 她变得温驯多了
Hey, man, she's been doing a lot better.

1577
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,180
一定要请兽医
So just make sure the vet techs, you know,

1578
01:32:46,180 --> 01:32:48,400
重新鉴定她 给她一个机会
reevaluate her, give her a chance.

1579
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,660
好 他们有自己的程序
Yeah, yeah, they got their protocol.

1580
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,660
你听到了 说到做到
You heard me. Make sure.

1581
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:56,270
交接完 你会打给琼斯上尉吧？
So as soon as we're done here, you're gonna call Captain Jones, yeah?

1582
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:57,220
上头有吩咐
That's what they're telling me.

1583
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,890
干嘛 你想惹毛她吗？
What are you... Look, man, are you trying to piss her off?

1584
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,420
你会没事的 好吗？
All right. You're gonna be okay, all right?

1585
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:11,030
好了 我没时间 走吧
Come on, man, I ain't got all day, let's go.

1586
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:12,380
我套住一下就好
I'm just gonna put this on you.

1587
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,950
给他们好看
Give 'em hell.

1588
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:22,000
走吧 快点
All right, let's go.

1589
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,630
不行 不行
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.

1590
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,330
别想了
Come on.

1591
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:12,740
别冲动
God. Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1592
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,620
等等 等等
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

1593
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:27,370
等等 等等
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1594
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:29,280
嗨 嗨 没事
Hi, hi, hi. No. It's fine. It's fine.

1595
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:29,580
我的错
My bad.

1596
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:32,280
我应该让她穿上背心
I should have... You know what, I should have put a vest on her.

1597
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:34,200
她穿背心会比较听话
She listens more when the vest is on.

1598
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,030
这妹子很有个性
You know girls and their fashion.

1599
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,380
很快回来 上车
I'll be right back. Up!

1600
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:43,690
先生 你忘记你的证件
Sir, you forgot your ID.

1601
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:47,040
送你好了
Uh, you know what, man, why don't you keep it?

1602
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,080
感谢你为国效力
Thank you for your service.

1603
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:52,610
那狗呢？
Hey, man, what about the dog?

1604
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:55,520
玩什么把戏？看什么看？
What are you... What are you looking at?

1605
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:58,700
别害我爆哭
Let's not make this all emotional, okay?

1606
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,110
亲爱的露露

莱利会很骄傲
Riley would be so proud.

1609
01:35:38,350 --> 01:35:40,440

Maybe even of both of us.

1610
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:52,320
听着 我不会写诗
Look, I'm no good at this poem stuff,

1611
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:56,320
所以我直接讲重点
so I'll just get to the damn point.

1612
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:00,370
谢谢
Thanks.

1613
