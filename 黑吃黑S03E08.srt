1
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,390
-布罗克  -什么事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Brock. - Yeah?

2
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,240
住手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stop!

3
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,960
擅闯我的地盘  你们最好有充分的理由
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Better have a damn good reason for trespassing on my land.

4
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,210
如果这是你的地盘
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If this is your land,

5
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,380
你一定就是萨尼·克劳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you must be Sani Crow.

6
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,560
我们找切顿·里特斯通
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're looking for Chayton Littlestone.

7
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,030
他杀了我们的朋友  她是个警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He killed our friend. She was a cop.

8
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,900
那你们这趟算是白费了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then you came a long way for nothing.

9
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,330
我操  都怪你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, fuck. I blame you for this.

10
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,750
你说切顿杀的那个女人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This woman you say Chayton killed,

11
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,330
她怎么得罪他了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}what did she do to him?

12
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,870
没得罪他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nothing.

13
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,260
那他为什么杀她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then why would he take her life?

14
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,180
因为他是个变态
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'Cause he's a fucking psychopath.

15
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,930
有段时间你们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There was a time when you people

16
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,960
都该管他叫野人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}would have called him a wild savage instead.

17
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,430
对  这么叫他没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, that sounds about right.

18
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,580
听着  他来寻求你的帮助
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen, he came to you for help

19
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,320
然后你给他庇护
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you gave him sanctuary.

20
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,990
这我理解  他是你的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I understand that. He's your people.

21
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,330
但现在方圆一千英里内
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But right now every cop

22
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,570
所有警察都在找他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}within a thousand miles is looking for him.

23
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,330
这种麻烦你也惹不起吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not even you can avoid that kind of heat.

24
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,830
所以我没让他留下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why I didn't allow him to stay.

25
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,260
-他什么时候走的  -胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- When did he leave? - Hood.

26
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,460
在几天前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A few days before you showed up.

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,100
他去哪里了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And where did he go?

28
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,780
最有可能去了法国区那边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My best guess would be the Quarter.

29
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,750
那地方不大
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not a big place.

30
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,500
我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go.

31
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,650
我敢打赌他在说谎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hundred bucks says he's lying.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,850
-没关系  -为什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Doesn't matter. - Why not?

33
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,880
他让我们去法国区
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He sent us to the French Quarter.

34
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,620
不管他出卖我们还是切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whether he's selling us out or Chayton,

35
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,580
最终我们都是去那里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we all end up in the same place.

36
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,380

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah!

38
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,170
布罗克  你看到他了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brock, do you see him?

39
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,970
我什么都看不到  人太他妈多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't see anything. The crowd's too damn thick.

40
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,890
狠揍那个狗娘养的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hit that motherfucker.

41
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,650
-狠揍那个狗娘养的  -伙计们  我们来加注
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hit that motherfucker. - Boys, let's up the ante.

42
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,450
我们来点真格的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's get some real shit up in here.

43
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,000
好  好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

44
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,430
耶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah!

45
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,220
你怎么会到这种鬼地方来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How the hell did you get down there?

46
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,370
女士们先生们  压轴大戏马上开演
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for our main event.

47
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,480
这方  来自鬼知道是哪里来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In this corner, from God knows where,

48
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,750
量级...谁他妈管这么多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}weighing in at-- who gives a fuck?

49
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,520
我们战无不胜的冠军
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Our undefeated champion

50
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,780
屠杀者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the Slayer!

51
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,290
是我鼻子有问题  还是这儿真的臭气熏天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is it me, or does this entire place smell like ass?

52
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,620
现在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And now,

53
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,090
让我们欢迎大家最喜爱的选手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}joining us in a surprise appearance,

54
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,220
在地下搏击场惊艳登场
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a favorite here at the Underground.

55
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,280
重生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Born again.

56
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,490
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, yeah.

57
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,980
切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Chayton!

58
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood.

59
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,400
抱歉  借过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry. Excuse me.

60
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,590
我看不到你  你在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't see you. Where are you?

61
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,930
胡德  你在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood, where are you?

62
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,290
干掉他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Finish him.

63
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,110
操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck.

64
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,150
胡德  你他妈干嘛呢  胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood, what the hell are you doing? Hood!

65
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,300
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

66
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,110
那个女条子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The lady cop,

67
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,310
生前是你的女人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}she was your woman?

68
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,990
很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good.

69
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,970
不许动  切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't move, Chayton.

70
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,420
去你的吧  条子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck you, cop.

71
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,530
我下一枪会轰掉你的脑袋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The next shot will blow your fucking face off.

72
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,980
这里不许带枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There are no guns allowed in here.

73
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,230
我们是警察  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're cops, asshole.

74
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,480
这个人因涉嫌谋杀被通缉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This man is wanted for murder.

75
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,090
这里不一样  在这里  他受我保护
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not here, he's not. Here, that man is under my protection.

76
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,510
好  那我也崩了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine. I'll shoot you, too.

77
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,850
这招不错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now that'd be a neat trick.

78
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,700
跟计划不一样啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This didn't go as planned.

79
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,220
-切顿  -操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}-Chayton. - Fuck.

80
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,630
跟你打的这人也是个条子吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that man you're fighting also a pig?

81
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,830
是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes.

82
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,160
虽然我很乐意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, as much as I'd love

83
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,710
让这些粉丝们得偿所愿  观赏死亡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to give these fans the death they deserve,

84
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,850
但恐怕杀死警官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think that killing a police officer

85
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,650
会使我和执法部门的关系复杂化
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}might complicate my arrangement with local law enforcement.

86
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,390
够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're done.

87
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,220
够了  切顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're done, Chayton!

88
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,630
改日再会  条子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll see you again, cop.

89
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,180
还他妈用你说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, you fucking know you will.

90
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,480
先生们  你们要知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, what you gentlemen need to understand

91
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,030
切顿在地下搏击场
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is that Chyton is a beloved figure here

92
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,570
深受欢迎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}at the Underground.

93
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,610
你现在还没被这些狂热的粉丝们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And it is only my goodwill

94
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,790
碎尸万段
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that is keeping these dedicated fans

95
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,540
全靠的是我的善心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}from tearing you apart limb from limb.

96
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,660
我打赌
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I'll wager you,

97
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,030
趁着我的善心还在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you got roughly 60 seconds

98
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,380
你能有大概六十秒时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}before that goodwill fails me.

99
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,110
现在开始
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Starting now.

100
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,430
来  走  咱们快出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, let's go. Let's get the hell out.

101
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,790
来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on.

102
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,030
该死  我还以为任务就是盯着切顿呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God damn it, I thought the plan was to watch Chayton.

103
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,260
我不想再次放掉他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I didn't want to lose him again.

104
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,970
我确定一定以及肯定他刚刚已经走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm pretty sure that's what just happened.

105
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,810
-现在他知道我们来了  -这说法算温和的了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Now he knows we're here. - That's an understatement.

106
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,340
他要是离开新奥尔良怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What if he leaves New Orleans?

107
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,690
他哪也去不了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's not going anywhere.

108
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,550
博登  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it, Burton?

109
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,800
我们在工厂对货品清单有一点小分歧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a small discrepancy in inventory at the factory.

110
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,950
-怎么  货少了  -正相反
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What, missing product? - The opposite.

111
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,570
我们的利润貌似比销售要多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It seems we're showing more profit than sales.

112
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,550
这倒是个不错的问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that's a good problem to have.

113
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,920
您想让我怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What would you like me to do?

114
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,320
调查一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look into it.

115
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,850
告诉我你查到什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me what you find out.

116
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,730
还有事吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anything else?

117
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,560
没了  就这事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. Nothing else.

118
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,890
博登看起来有点忧心忡忡的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Burton looked worried.

119
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,680
博登一直都那副样子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, Burton always looks worried.

120
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,910
生意上的事罢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's just business.

121
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,700
我以为你出去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, I thought you went out.

122
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,850
你想错了  又一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You thought wrong, again.

123
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,220
你丢了什么东西吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you lose something?

124
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,590
不是东西  十二万五千美金
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not something. $125,000.

125
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,520
很明显  有人不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Apparently some motherfucker

126
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,020
我还会数数
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}forgot I'm the one who can count.

127
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,610
你是怎么想的  要拿这些钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck were you thinking taking that money?

128
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,030
打住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now hold on.

129
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,860
比起我现在的麻烦  这只是小事一桩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's just a small taste of what I got coming to me.

130
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,720
在我们想出解决办法之前  这都不算事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nothing coming to no one until we all decide how to handle it.

131
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,240
我又不是要跑路去大西洋城
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not like I'm running off to Atlantic City.

132
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,360
我可不是傻子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not an idiot.

133
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,260
你看起来就像一个傻子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You doing a damn good impression of one.

134
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,000
我遇到点事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Something came up.

135
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,070
-什么事  -私人的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What? - Something personal.

136
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,620
你知道这么多就够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's all you need to know.

137
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,600
喂  你要去哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey. Hey!

138
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,650
别管了  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let it go, Job.

139
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,390
我可不是为了替你收拾烂摊子的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I ain't sitting on this just to cover for your fat ass.

140
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,530
你听明白没
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You hear me?

141
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,450
做你该做的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You do what you got to do.

142
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,590
我也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So will I.

143
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,740
直接把包带去交易点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take the bag directly to the drop point.

144
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,900
只能把包给莫拉莱斯本人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You deliver to Morales himself or no one at all.

145
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,100
-记住了吗  -记住了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Okay? - Yes, ma'am.

146
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,430
有问题吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there a problem?

147
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,470
如果你叔叔发现了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If your uncle finds out...

148
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,400
有些机会是要抓住的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Some chances are worth taking.

149
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,100
你难道不这么认为吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't you think?

150
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,610
是的  女士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, ma'am.

151
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,610
完事之后打电话给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Call me when you're finished.

152
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,960
你违反了我们跟弗拉奇尔的协议
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're violating our agreement with Frazier

153
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,970
把货卖给了萨尔瓦多人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and selling to the Salvadorans.

154
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,760
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes.

155
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,570
你叔叔不会允许的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your uncle won't like that.

156
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,080
那就别告诉他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then don't tell him.

157
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,260
把这当做我们的秘密
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It can be our secret.

158
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,160
到最后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And in the end...

159
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,680
他会因此感谢我们的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he'll thank us for it.

160
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,260
我不会告诉他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not going to tell him.

161
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,570
应该由你来说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It should come from you.

162
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,440
我是想要帮他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm trying to help him.

163
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,820
你难道看不出吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can't you see that?

164
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,640
这个女人让他变得软弱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This woman is making him weak.

165
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,050
他正在做出错误的决定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's making bad decisions.

166
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,390
把从前的成果全都拿来冒险
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's risking everything he's built.

167
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,030
不会这样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's not going to happen.

168
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,240
已经这样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's already happening.

169
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,900
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fine.

170
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,870
做你想做的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do what you have to do.

171
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,610
不过提醒你  你这是逼他在我们之中选一个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But just know you'll be making him pick between us.

172
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,160
你真的觉得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And do you really think

173
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,560
他会选你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he'll choose you

174
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,920
而不是他特别的侄女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}over his very special niece?

175
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,870
再来一次  很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Again. Good, good.

176
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,620
很好  一二三  躲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's it. One, two, three, slip.

177
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,960
好样的  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There you go, baby.

178
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,010
上勾拳  上勾拳  一二三四
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uppercuts, uppercuts-- one, two, three, four, five,

179
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,700
二二三四
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

180
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,650
没错  一二三  躲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's it. One, two, three, slip.

181
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,950
保持  头抬起来  抬起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay-- keep your head up. Keep your head up.

182
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,580
一二三  躲  一二三  躲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One, two, three, slip. One, two, three, slip.

183
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,810
-奥斯卡  -沙格
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Oscar. - Shug.

184
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,790
你在这干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doing here?

185
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,760
他怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How's he doing?

186
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,440
从各方面来看  他还挺不错的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He was doing good, all things considered.

187
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,930
不过几个月前还挺糟糕的  你知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But a few months back, things got bad, you know?

188
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,910
天天跟医生护士打交道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Between the doctors, the nurses,

189
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,150
不停地换新药
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all the new prescriptions,

190
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,920
压得我们喘不过气来  沙格
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're drowning, Shug.

191
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,230
打开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Open it.

192
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,870
天呐
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus.

193
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,530
不  这太多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, this is way too much.

194
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,580
我欠你父亲的可比这些多多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not even close to what I owe your old man.

195
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,540
听着  爸爸只是像所有其他拳击手一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, Pop took his chances just like every other boxer

196
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,120
上场搏命罢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that climbs into that ring.

197
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,940
当时倒下的说不定也会是你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Could have just as easily been you.

198
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,230
不是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It wasn't.

199
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,400
你要不四处看看吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you stick around, you know?

200
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,380
你可以指点指点这些毛头小子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You could give some of those young punks

201
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,860
传授你的智慧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the benefit of your wisdom.

202
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,320
这个袋子就是我所有的智慧所在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That bag is about all the wisdom I got left.

203
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,240
你想把我吓出心脏病吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You trying to give me a heart attack?

204
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,490
求之不得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A girl can dream.

205
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,410
说吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Start talking.

206
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,790
不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

207
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
你一点都不幼稚  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's real mature, Job.

208
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,700
现在你告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now you tell me

209
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,270
你他妈到底把钱给谁了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who did you give that motherfucking money to?

210
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,710
他叫小奥斯卡·克鲁兹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}His name is Oscar Cruz, Jr.

211
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,120
他父亲曾经是拳击手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}His father was a fighter.

212
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,680
所以呢  你是忘记给他儿子送成年礼吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, what, you forgot his son's bar mitzvah present?

213
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,960
西尼尔当时并未做好上场的准备
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Senior wasn't ready for that fight.

214
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,570
但主办方不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The promoters didn't care.

215
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,790
我也不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I didn't care either.

216
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,180
箭在弦上不得不发
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, the title was on the line.

217
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,620
我下了几次重手后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The ref should have stopped

218
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,410
裁判应该马上叫停比赛的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the fight after I landed a few big ones.

219
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,220
天知道我控制不住了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lord knows I couldn't.

220
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,950
他的头撞到围栏上前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}By the time his head hit that canvas,

221
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,900
我对他脑子猛击了好几下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had scrambled his brains so badly

222
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,670
以至于他后来再也没法说话了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that he would never speak again.

223
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,650
那他现在在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So where is he now?

224
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,410
他住在西部某家奇贵无比的疗养院里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's in some overpriced nursing home out West.

225
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,800
流着口水  穿着尿布
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Drooling and wearing a diaper.

226
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,630
现在你能把
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, could you please

227
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,960
分电盖还给我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}give me my distributor cap back?

228
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,770
有人在吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is anyone there?

229
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,780
看起来你在这被关了很久了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, looks like you've been down here quite some time.

230
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,350
他们好像把你整得很惨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They worked you over real good.

231
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,670
永远未雨绸缪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Always be prepared.

232
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,190
别担心  我不会伤害你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt you.

233
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,450
我不会伤害你  我给你松开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not gonna hurt you. I'll cut you loose.

234
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,360
慢慢来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just take your time.

235
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,520
我马上回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll be right back.

236
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,160
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go.

237
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,360
留了一个人给你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I saved one for you.

238
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,100
来吧  我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, let's go.

239
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,250
有什么事吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can I help you?

240
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,220
我要帮你变成更好的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am going to help you become a better man.

241
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,300
你到底在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck are you talking about?

242
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,420
他跟你说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What did he tell you?

243
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,950
你要有风度地把他给你的钱还回去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You are going to graciously return all the money he gave you.

244
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,970
那钱是给我父亲的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That money was a gift to my father.

245
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,580
老奥斯卡·克鲁兹  2007年11月逝世
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oscar Cruz, Sr., died in November of 2007.

246
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,850
我见过你伪造的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I saw your handiwork with the forged

247
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,450
医院表格和保险记录
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}hospital forms and insurance records.

248
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,300
他儿子已经冒领他的福利多年
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Junior's been collecting his benefits for years.

249
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,640
也差不多玩了你这么多年
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Almost as long as he's been playing you.

250
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,990
糖果以为我根本不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sugar thinks I have no clue

251
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,860
那晚比赛时发生的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}what really happened in the fight that night.

252
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,610
但我清楚他那样对我父亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I know what he did

253
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,490
根本不是因为拳击比赛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to my father had nothing to do with boxing.

254
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,780
他夺走了一切...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He took everything...

255
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,360
混蛋  我不是来听你叨叨的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bitch, I ain't come to hear your sob story.

256
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,950
我来拿钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I come for the money.

257
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,270
那就自己来拿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then come and take it.

258
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,560
不管你过去做了什么都不关我的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What you did or did not do in the past don't mean shit to me.

259
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,990
我关心的是此时此刻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What concerns me is a colleague

260
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,250
我的同伴不能按他妈的计划行事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that can't keep to the motherfucking plan in the here and now.

261
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,130
你要记住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just want you to remember

262
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,820
我给过你这个混蛋机会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I gave your punk ass a chance.

263
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,630
要像蝴蝶一样灵巧  兔崽子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Float like a butterfly, motherfucker.

264
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,960
你自以为知道事实  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You think you know what happened, Job,

265
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,730
但并非如此
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but you don't.

266
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,200
她是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who was she?

267
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,800
如果既不为钱又不为名
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, if it ain't for money and it ain't for glory,

268
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,360
那只剩一个可能了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}there's only one thing left.

269
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,830
那个女人是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who was she?

270
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,150
她叫瓦内萨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Her name was Vanessa.

271
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,790
我爱她  但是她爱着他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I loved her, but she loved him.

272
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,300
我能听到她在人群中为她的男人欢呼雀跃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I could hear her in the stands cheering for her man.

273
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,520
但那个人不是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A man who wasn't me.

274
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,860
我觉得非常痛苦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I never felt that kind of pain.

275
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,930
我不知道如何是好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I didn't know what to do with it.

276
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,450
所以我让奥斯卡来处理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So I gave it to Oscar to deal with instead.

277
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,730
25年来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For 25 years,

278
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,100
我把节省下来的都给了他们家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I sent his family anything I could spare.

279
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,610
虽然不多  但是我的心意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wasn't much, but it was something.

280
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,130
听我说  放下吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen to me. Let it go.

281
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,570
我听这些悲悲切切的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have had more than my fair share

282
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,260
听得够多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}of Podunk Tragedy Theater.

283
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,500
我没那么多精力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I do not have the energy.

284
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,070
等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey.

285
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,380
你可以留着这些钱的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You could have kept that money, you know.

286
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,320
完全不用跟我打招呼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Didn't have to say a damn word to me.

287
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,070
为什么还回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So why'd you give it back?

288
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,210
我并没有全还给你啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I didn't give it all back.

289
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,340
*你的爱就是一剂猛药*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* Your love ain't never been so strong *

290
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,080
*你的爱就是一剂猛药*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* Your love ain't never been so strong *

291
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,600
*十六只蜡烛正燃烧*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* 16 candles burning *

292
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,060
*缠绵整夜到破晓*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* Make love all night long *

293
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,750
*爱是*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* Love is *

294
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,510
*两条河流并排流淌*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* Two rivers running side by side *

295
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,270
*爱是*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* Love is *

296
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,390
*两条河流并排流淌*
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}* Two rivers running side by side *

297
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,260
这里没一个人肯跟我们说话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ain't nobody in here gonna talk to us.

298
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,790
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

299
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,810
但他们会和切顿说话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But they'll talk to Chayton.

300
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,380
等他来找我们吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And he'll find us?

301
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,540
我是这么想的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's the idea.

302
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,840
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, Hood,

303
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,540
我们共事时间也不短了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we've been working together for a while now

304
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,880
可我发现
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I realized

305
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,710
我根本不了解你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know the first thing about you.

306
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,930
比如  你是哪里人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, like where you're from.

307
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,540
你老家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Originally.

308
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,490
满街都是大白天就喝酒的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Town full of day drinkers.

309
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,490
看得出他们...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's a concept I can get--

310
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,300
你有什么心事吗  布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got something on your mind, Brock?

311
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,450
好像有吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I guess I do.

312
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,880
你看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know,

313
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,940
我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when we--

314
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,780
我们杀了本渡后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when we killed Hondo,

315
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,080
我就发誓再也不杀人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I swore to myself never again.

316
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,260
可我现在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And yet here I am

317
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,620
才没过多久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a short while later

318
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,290
就又来跟你杀人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}on another assassination junket.

319
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,030
有时法律无法给人正义还人公道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sometimes the law can't give justice.

320
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,420
别欺骗自己了  胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, don't kid yourself, Hood.

321
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,680
这不是正义
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This isn't justice.

322
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,360
杀本渡也不是正义
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hondo wasn't justice, okay?

323
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,530
这只是冰冷残酷而又自私的报复
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is cold, hard, self-serving revenge.

324
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,700
我们是杀人犯  别欺骗自己了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're killers, okay? Don't make us idiots.

325
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,340
他妈的声音轻点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Keep your fucking voice down.

326
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,790
管他们干什么  全都是醉鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who gives a shit? They're all drunk.

327
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,380
-你得冷静  -去他妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You need to calm down. - Fuck that, man.

328
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,690
我们开车横跨五州到这就为了杀一个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We drove through five states to come here to kill a man.

329
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,180
你不必杀人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't have to kill anyone.

330
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,810
那我来这里干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then what the hell am I doing here?

331
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,760
我来这里干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Huh? What am I doing here?

332
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,170
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

333
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,910
好爽啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, my God.

334
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,420
爽死我了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, fuck.

335
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,640
你杀不了我  条子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can't kill me, cop.

336
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,390
你只是凡人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're just a man.

337
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,610
没人能杀死我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No man can kill me.

338
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,860
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

339
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,160
靠  快给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn it, give me that.

340

{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}新奥尔良港

341
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,300
我低估了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I underestimated you.

342
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,170
你不是警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not a cop.

343
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,990
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

344
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,940
你们总是生活在谎言中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your people deal in lies.

345
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,880
你永远不会理解
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You will never understand

346
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,800
真正目标的纯洁性
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the purity of true purpose.

347
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,020
精神召唤的纯洁性
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Of a spiritual calling.

348
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,110
你什么都不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're nothing.

349
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:49,790
我是名勇士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am a warrior.

350
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:56,890
我就是用这双手掐住她的脖子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I held her neck in these hands.

351
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,330
那么的纤弱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So delicate.

352
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,090
我的指尖可以感受到她跳动的脉搏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Felt her pulse tapping against my fingertips.

353
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,160
感受到她的生命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The life running through her.

354
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,070
趁当地警察还没赶来  我们应该
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We should probably get the hell out of Dodge

355
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,760
赶紧离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}before the locals show up, huh?

356
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,380
胡德  我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood, let's go.

357
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,820
我不能回去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't go back.

358
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,210
你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

359
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,330
我要做的都做完了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm done.

360
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,540
那没有什么让我留恋的了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got nothing left.

361
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,550
所以就这样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So that's it?

362
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,740
你就打算这么离开吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're just gonna walk away?

363
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,550
为了弄明白你是什么人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I've been driving myself crazy

364
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:03,070
我快把自己逼疯了  但是够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}trying to figure you out, but I'm done.

365
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,980
你现在是谁  原来是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who you are, who you were,

366
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,340
从什么地方来  我都不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}where you're from, I don't care.

367
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:11,530
我现在都不在乎了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't care anymore.

368
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,540
我唯一在乎的是我的小镇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The only thing I care about is my town.

369
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,500
凯·普罗斯特用他的方式控制我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kai Proctor has been having his way with us,

370
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,030
控制我们所有人太久了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all of us, for way too long.

371
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,280
但是你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you,

372
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,760
你是唯一一个那个混蛋控制不了的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you're the first guy that bastard couldn't own.

373
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,460
你和我一起  我们可以把他彻底扳倒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And together, you and me, we could take him down for good.

374
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,000
不感兴趣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

375
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,300
真见鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God damn it.

376
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,690
你觉得她想要的是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you think she would have wanted, huh?

377
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,280
我不会一个人回女妖镇的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not going back to Banshee without you.

378
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,400
你要打完这场战争
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gotta finish what you started.

379
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,180
就算拖我也要亲自把你拖回去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Even if I've got to kick your ass all the way back there myself.

380
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,210
我不会一个人离开的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not leaving without you.

381
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,600
你说完了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you done?

382
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,820
说完了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think so.

383
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,670
那走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on.

384
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,540
以主和教会的名义
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In the name of the Lord and the Church,

385
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,960
我们向你伸出信徒之手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we extend to you the hand of fellowship.

386
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:49,070
我为了自己的缘故而清楚你们的罪行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}"I am He who blots out your transgressions for my own sake

忘却你们的罪行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and remembers your sins no more."

389
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,520
请起身  从此你就是教会忠实的一员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rise up and be ye a faithful member of the Church.

392
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,790
这个是你妈妈留下的

谢谢你  父亲

399
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,870
我还以为你和那个当兵的结束了呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought you and soldier boy were done.

400
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,710
我们是结束了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are.

401
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,900
他知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Does he know that?

402
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,620
你好  卡莉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hello, Carrie.

403
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,670
天哪  你怎么了

我被打劫了

道格  你没事吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Doug, are you okay?

406
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,080
我会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will be.

407
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,000
你报警了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you call the cops?

408
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,040
没  我自己处理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I'll be handling this myself.

409
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,080
也许你能帮我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe you can help.

410
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,860
我知道你父亲对违法犯罪不陌生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I understand your father was no stranger to illegal behavior.

411
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,450
也许你能指点我犯罪心理的玄妙之处
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe you could shed some light on the nuances of the criminal mind.

412
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,330
我跟我父亲的关系很复杂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My father and I had a complicated relationship.

413
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,960

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I doubt I'd be much help.

414
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,070
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

415
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,750
请再给我倒点水
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'd like some more water, please.

416
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,590
没问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Of course.

417
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,090
他们从旧作业隧洞进入
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They came in through the old service tunnel.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}These guys used our own defenses to their advantage.

421

利用立体复制模具和高端复制声音发生器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The biometric lock was bypassed using a dimensional latent clone

422
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,680

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and high-end vocal replication generator.

423
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,050
有人近到可以窃取你的声音和指纹

426
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,710
接下来  只需一个有经验的破箱人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}After that, all they needed was an experienced safecracker.

427
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:41,830
就这样  我们的钱成了他们的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And just like that, our money was theirs.

428
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,810

430
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,630
先说黑客
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Start with the hacker.

431
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,910
他破解了我设的每个密码
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He defeated every encryption I set up,

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}avoided every malware trap.

433

这还不止
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And beyond that,

434
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:58,650
他还黑进了坚不可摧的主机把我们关在外
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}he hacked into an ironclad mainframe to shut us down.

435
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,710
你是说他跟你一样厉害吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're saying he's as good as you?

436
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,390
我是说他更厉害
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm saying he's better.

437
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,220
说说这个破箱人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me about the safecracker.

438

锁从死点钻开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The lock was drilled dead center,

439
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,130
换向齿轮被轻易操纵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the tumblers manipulated with a gentle touch.

440
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,630
方法简单  优雅
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The approach was simple, elegant.

441
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,050
专业人士的手法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The work of a professional.

442
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:23,670
你确定不要别的了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you sure I can't get you anything else?

443
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,040
今天不要了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not today.

444
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,230
我没弄懂的是你在隧道里对战的那人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The one I haven't figured out is the one you fought in the tunnel.

445
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,300
他受过很好的训练
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He was well trained.

446
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,020
致命  但有点生疏了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lethal, but a little rusty.

447
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,470
他让他的对手活着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He allowed his enemy to live

448
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,410
而不是割了对方的喉咙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}instead of cutting his throat.

449
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,040
说明他变心软了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It shows he's gone soft.

450
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,770
也许是有良心了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe grown a conscience.

451
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,020
为什么他的同伴在他撤出之前就炸隧道了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why have his partners blow the tunnel before he was clear?

452
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,040
忠诚  愿为目标献身
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Loyalty and a commitment to the objective.

453
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,870

解散所有士兵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dismiss all enlisted personnel.

455
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,090
我要他们一小时内离开基地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want them off the base within the hour.

456
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,960
是的  长官

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Camp Genoa is officially shut down.

459
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,880
我们要抓到他们并且拿回属于我们的东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're gonna hunt them down and take back what they stole from us.

460
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,650
然后我们要让他们付出代价
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then we will make them pay.
