{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You killed a cop. - Allegedly.

4
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,060
你还到处炫耀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then you bragged about it.

5
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,010
那你就逮捕我啊  美女
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So arrest me, sweetheart.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right? You got nothing tying me

7
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,080
跟我扯不上关系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to that nigger friend of yours.

8
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,660
不信你们就尽管去查证
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, why don't you see if you can make it stick?

9
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,760
不  就是你杀了我们的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. You killed our friend.

10
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,190
我们不会逮捕你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're not gonna arrest you.

11
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,210
你这话什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you talkin' about?

12
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,700
你说得对  我们无法查证
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're right, we couldn't make it stick.

13
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,010
你们他妈不是警察吗  抓我啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're fucking cops, okay? Arrest me.

14
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,320
看到警徽了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See any badges?

15
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,440
你他妈可是警长啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're the fuckin' sheriff!

16

你想什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where do you go?

19
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,040
什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you mean?

20
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,720
我是说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's like...

21
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,280
你都不想看我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you can't even look at me.

22
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,600
不是那样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's nothing like that.

23
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,620
你真该考虑换个住处了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, maybe you should really think about getting a new place.

24
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,880
你不觉得这里有种老式的魅力吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Eh, it has a certain old-school charm, no?

25
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,450
不觉得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

26
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,620
这里租金便宜啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, you can't beat the rent.

27
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,840
我是说  就算只是床上关系
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, I get that this isn't a relationship,

28
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,740
我也可以接受
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I'm fine with that.

29
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,630
我得去工作了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have to go to work.

30
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,220
你至少雇个人打扫打扫吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You could at least hire a cleaning service or something.

31
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,550
我不喜欢别人碰我的东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't like people touching my things.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is where Sugar's old crap goes to die.

35
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,540
某人现在住房车里  还好意思这么说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, this coming from the girl who lives in an Airstream.

36
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,830
你看起来就像
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You just seem like somebody

37
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,470
特别需要个朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who could use a friend is all I'm saying.

38
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,420
我们都是成年人  只是在汽车旅馆上床而已
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're just two adults having sex in a motel room.

39
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,540
算了  先不起床了

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

53
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,260
安静
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Quiet.

-你想贾伯了吗  -不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You missing Job? - No.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm just sayin' how nice and quiet it's been

56
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,680
我们的日子是多么静谧祥和啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}since you got back from your little trip to New York last month.

57
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,930
你不喜欢这样吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got a problem with quiet?

58
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:57,790
刚好相反
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}On the contrary.

59
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,810
静谧不再的时候我会想念的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna miss it when it's gone.

60
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,590
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes?

61
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,570
关于我们讨论过的问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In regards to the matter we discussed,

62
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,430
你应该去地下室一趟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you should come down to the basement.

63
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,150
-现在吗  -对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Now? - Yes.

他准备开口了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is he ready to talk?

65
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,230
看来你俩度过了一个愉快的夜晚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Looks like you two made quite a night of it.

66
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,390
我知道  我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know, I know.

67
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,970
博登的问话风格有时候会很呆板
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Burton's interview style can be a little rigid at times,

68
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,700
但是他一丝不苟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but he's very precise.

69
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,790
这些伤口会愈合的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}These cuts will all heal.

70
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,760
前提是你能活到那个时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You just make sure you live long enough to let that happen.

71
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,670
你明白吗  很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you understand? Good.

72
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,590
吉姆·凯奇是不是一直给费城那边供货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, has Jim Cage been supplying Philadelphia with molly?

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And he's been selling to Frazier exclusively?

75
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,020
他们比你的价低
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They cut your prices.

76
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,290

82
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,320

控告我持有非法武器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Charging me with unlicensed firearms.

97
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,180
你只能做到这种程度吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That was the best you could do?

98
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,020
我要一直这么吊着你  直到找出证据控告你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hust getting the ball rolling till I can charge you

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have an airtight alibi, don't I?

102
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,800

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You had me locked up, remember?

103
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,470
在我看来  对付你这样的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The way I see it, a guy like you,

104
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,630

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll get another shot.

105
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,100
不过你的业绩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, but your track record isn't exactly

106
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,020
让我不怎么担心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}giving me much cause for concern.

107

再见  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See you around, Kai.

108

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I still come in every day expecting to see Emmett there.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hey. - Raven.

我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen, I know that I...

113
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,890
我的前任工作很多  我得接替他

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But all I did was answer an ad.

116
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,830
真抱歉  对你来说肯定很不容易
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry. This can't be easy for you.

117
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,600
是不容易  但这能让我的家人离开居留地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not, but it gets my family off the reservation.

118
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,550
为宾州警察局干了六年之后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I gotta tell you after working six years for KPD,

119
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,820

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}it's great to be working in an actual functioning police station.

办实事  说的就是我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Functional. That's us.

121
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,100
胡德  你有空吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Hood, you got a minute?

122
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,230
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah. What's up?

123
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,010
本渡的档案
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hondo file.

124
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,100
法医说他们不会派人去取
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Medical examiner said they're not gonna send out

125
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,440
弹道痕迹检测结果
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for ballistics on the bullets.

126
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,970
我想他们是优先处理了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're prioritizing, I guess.

127
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,360
我检查了那片区域
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I, I canvassed the area.

128
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,500
看起来没人发现我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one seems to have seen anything.

129
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,220
基本上  官方一致认为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, basically, the official consensus is

130
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,920
是三个无名持枪者清理了公害
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}three anonymous shooters did the world a favor

131
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,970
大家都可以睡个好觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and nobody's gonna lose any sleep over

132
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,690
不用担心这个新纳粹分子出来捣鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a dead neo-Nazi with multiple priors.

133
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,440
-所以...  -我觉得挺好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- So... - Sounds good to me.

134
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,440
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}OK.

135
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,680
还有事吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Something else?

136
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,280
你就没有一点困扰吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you even fazed by this?

137
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,910
我们处决了一个人  胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We executed a man, Hood.

138
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,770
他杀了我们的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He killed one of us.

139
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,920
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know that.

140
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,670
我理解
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I understand.

141
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,450
你以前干过这种事吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've done this sort of thing before?

142
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,680
什么事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What?

143
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,770
杀人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Killed a man?

144
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,040
不  行刑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, executed him.

145
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,710
布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brock...

146
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,710
你会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you'll be okay.

147
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,390
-出发吧  -别养成习惯了好吗  我...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Now let's go. - Let's just not make a habit of it, okay? I...

148
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,360
父亲知道我们经常这样见面吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Does Father know that we've been meeting like this?

149
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,740
问这个干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To what end?

150
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,600
你知道他不会来的  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't think he'll join us, do you?

151
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,520
但也许某一天他会想知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you would think at one point he'd want to know

152
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,220
他的儿子是怎样的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}what became of his son.

153
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,600
坦诚地说  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's be honest, Kai.

154
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,380
你现在的样子  正是他所惧怕的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who you've become is exactly what he is afraid of.

155
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,130
我的外孙女怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How is my granddaughter doing?

156
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,630
她很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She's fine.

157
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,190
打他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hit him!

158
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,520
烈火考验是红骨帮神圣的传统
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The fire trials are a sacred Redbone tradition

159
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,230
以证明你有能力成为领导者
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to prove yourself a worthy leader.

160
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,480
时代不同了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Times have changed

161
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,340
红骨帮必须与时俱进
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and the Redbones must change with them.

162
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,300
不对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wrong.

163
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,300
这里是警察局
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff's Department.

比利  比利

你得先按交接键
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have to press that interface button first

166
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,140
才能把电话从总机上转出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in order to pull the call off Alma's switchboard.

167
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,910
-谢谢  -明白了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Thanks. - Got it?

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- There you go. - Sheriff's Department.

171
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,120
洛特斯副警长刚刚出去了  有什么可以帮您的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deputy Lotus stepped away for a moment. Can I help you?

172
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,120
现在你能看到他吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you see him now?

173
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,820
所有门都关上了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are all your doors locked?

174
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,010
你能再检查一遍吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Can you check them for me, please?

175
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,450
告诉我你的地址
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And tell me your address.

176
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,280
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}奥克伍德巷63号

177
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,100
知道了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Got it.

178
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,860
好的  我们马上出发  女士
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, we're on our way, ma'am.

179
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,630
好的  有人报警说有小偷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, we got a prowler call.

180
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,130
有位女士说有人藏在她的灌木丛里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lady said there's a guy hiding in her shrubbery,in her backyard.

181
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,870
是奥克伍德巷63号吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is it 63 Oakwood Lane?

182
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,490
是啊  你怎么知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah. How'd you know?

183
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,130
熟能生巧  孩子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Time and experience, son.

184
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,830

值班就好  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and hold down the fort, all right?

187
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,820
时代没有改变
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Times have not changed.

188
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,310
五百年来我们一直被那些白人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are still being raped and plundered

189
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,570
蹂躏和掠夺
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}by the white man like we have been for 500 years.

190
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,740
我们有什么值得庆祝的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What exactly is it you think we're going to celebrate?

191
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,970
你已经离开了  谢顿  现在我说了算
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You left, Chayton. I'm in charge.

192
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,420
-我知道  -真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I understand. - Do you?

193
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,260
我不想跟你打
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't want to fight you.

194
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
我也不想跟你打
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't want to fight you, either,

195
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,670
除非你有其他法子  否则这是必须的  谢顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but that's how we do it unless you see another way, Chayton.

196
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,480
你可以直接认输
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You could just step down.

197
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,080
你会认输吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Would you?

198
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,320
-打够了吗  -够了  够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Had enough? - Yeah. Yeah.

-够了吗  -够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- We done? - Yeah.

200
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,070
我们在这的  所有人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We are here, all of us,

201
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,180
去打一场永远也不会赢得战争
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to fight in a war that we will never win

202
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,090
因为在百年之前我们就已经输了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}because it was lost by our people centuries ago.

203
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,470
我们赢不回我们的国家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We will never reclaim our country.

204
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,370
但我已经回来了  因为我愿意誓死而战
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I've come back because I'd rather die fighting

205
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,940
也不愿像奴隶一样苟活于这片土地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}than to live like a slave in my own land.

206
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,280
是时候开始反击了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's time we took something back.

207
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,750
有人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hello?

208
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,760
又是小偷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Another prowler, huh?

209
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,980
别再报假警了  艾米丽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gotta stop it with these prowler calls, Emily.

210
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,000
好吗  如果比利·雷文接到电话时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right? Look, what if I was out

211
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,610
我不在该怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when Billy Raven took that call?

212
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,090
谁是比利·雷文
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the hell's Billy Raven?

213
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,130
新警员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}New deputy.

214
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,350
-可怜的埃米特  -我得回去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Poor Emmett. - I gotta get back.

215
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,170
先跟我喝一杯吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just have a drink with me.

216
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
-小艾  我还在值班呢  -你总在上班
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Em, I'm on duty. - You're always on duty.

217
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,520
所以我们才离婚了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why we got divorced.

218
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,960
我们离婚是因为你和艾略特·格兰杰搞上了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, we got divorced because you were fucking Elliot Granger.

219
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,210
那是因为你总不在家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was fucking Elliot Granger because you were never home.

220
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,460
到底是先有鸡还是先有蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Classic chicken and the egg debate.

221
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,180
和我坐会吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just sit with me.

222
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,870
拜托了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please?

223
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,790
我只是有时候会寂寞
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just get lonely sometimes.

224
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,770
那就别一个人在晚上喝闷酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, maybe you shouldn't drink alone at night.

225
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,780
问题解决
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Done.

226
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,420
敬我们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To us.

227
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,640
好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

228
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,500
最近如何  工作...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How's everything? How's-- how's work and--

229
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,160
你用不着和我寒暄
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't have to make small talk with me.

230
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,310
别这样  快住手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on. Stop it.

231
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,680
别这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stop, stop.

232
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
该死的  小艾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn it, Em.

233
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,780
我只想确保你一切都好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

234
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,290
那就让我好起来吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then make me okay.

235
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,300
妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn it.

236
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,630
操我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck me.

237
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,430
用力点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Harder.

238
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,010
疼吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did it hurt?

239
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,930
针头刚刺进去的时候特别疼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, at first when they jab you with the needle it hurt a lot,

240
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,690
但是过一会儿你就习惯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but, I don't know, after a while you just kind of get used to it.

241
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,500
就跟我的生活一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Kind of like my life.

242
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,100
你爸找到新房子了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did your dad find a new place yet?

243
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,930
嗯  他要租一个小破公寓
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, he's renting this shitty little apartment.

244
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,850
真的挺烦人的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's pretty depressing, actually.

245
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,880
你爸妈平时说话吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He and your mom, like, talking?

246
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,000
偶尔吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sometimes, yeah.

247
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,290
一切都糟糕透顶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The whole thing is just so fucked up.

248
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,110
他们看到你的纹身都气疯了吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I bet they freaked when they saw your tat.

249
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,030
他们都顾着纠结自己的破事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're way too caught up in their own bullshit

250
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,840
哪里会注意我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to pay any attention to me.

251
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,290
我知道个地方能买到50刀的好啤酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know where we can get some premium bud for, like, 50 bucks.

252
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,300
-你有50刀吗  -没钱了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You have 50 bucks? - Tapped out.

253
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,390
放屁  你老是没钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No shit. You're always tapped out.

254
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,610
咬我啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bite me.

255
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,710
我有个主意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have an idea.

256
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,740
我操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Holy shit.

257
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,890
瘾君子的玩具反斗城啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's like a stoner's Toys "R" Us.

258

好了伙计们  该走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, guys. Guys, come on.

260

走啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on!

261

这是在深夜扫货吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Doing a little late-night shopping?

262
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,570

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You two, head home now.

263
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,540
这是最后一次警告
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Consider this your last warning.

264
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,830
他开玩笑的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is he joking?

265
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,650
你们两个  快走就是了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You guys, just-- just get out of here.

266
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,680
-你确定吗  -我没事  走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm fine. Just go!

267
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,430
给我把东西放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey! Leave the stuff.

268
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,870
这次又想做贼了  是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, you wanna be a thief now?

269
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,120
给你点建议
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A little piece of advice.

270
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,540
偷东西没你想的那么简单
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's harder than you think.

271
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,620
你的第一个错误  人太多
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your first mistake was your numbers.

272
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,970
多一个人  就多一分被抓的风险
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Every extra person increases your chances of getting caught

273
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,500
你们三个人干一个人的活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you had three people on a one-man job.

274
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,810
这不是个好开始
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not a great start.

275
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,540
跟我来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come with me.

276
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,290
看到门窗上的警报器了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You see an alarm on the door, window?

277
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,410
没有吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nope?

278
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,060
那我怎么这么快就来了呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So how did I get here so fast?

279
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,470
看到上面那个白盒子了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See that little white box up there?

280
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,050
那是声音感测器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's a sound sensor.

281
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,370
打碎玻璃  就会触发警报
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You break the glass, that triggers a silent alarm.

282
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,960
十秒后  广播通知警局
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}10 seconds later, my office is on the radio,

283
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,420
我就来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}here I am.

284
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,470
碰到玻璃只能用切开的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your only option with glass is a cutter.

285
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,460
这就是大奖了吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So this is it, huh? Jackpot.

286
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,890
偷了多少
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How much you got?

287
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,700
37块
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}37 dollars.

288
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,590
看  收银机也连着警报器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See, the register is also connected to the alarm.

289
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,390
所以你最好先搞定警报器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you would've been better to take the whole thing

290
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,080
再撬开收银机
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and open it when you got clear.

291
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,870
不过  如果真要存放一大笔钱过夜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Although, if there is any real cash left overnight...

292
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,650
那就肯定是存在保险柜里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}it's gonna be in the safe,

293
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,270
当然也已经牢牢固定在地板上了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}which is also bolted to the floor.

294
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,550
除非你知道怎么破开保险箱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So unless you know how to crack a safe...

295
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,150
不知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No?

296
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,770
那就真没被盗走多少钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then there's really nothing in here

297
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,510
也就没必要逮捕你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}worth getting arrested for.

298
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,320
除非  你想要这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Unless, of course, that was the point.

299
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,180
你觉得我想被抓吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You think I wanted to get caught?

300
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,350
咱家人都有作死基因呗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Self-destruction runs in the family.

301
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,120
我不觉得现在就可以开这种父女玩笑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A little soon to be making daddy jokes, don't you think?

302
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,400
我就试试

又是这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Again.

308
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:37,830
我懂我懂我懂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know, I know, I know.

但是你从没离过婚  所以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you've never been divorced, so...

311
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,200
我想告诉你的是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, look, I wanted to tell you...

312
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,940
我们整垮本渡了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we took care of Hondo.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, man, we made him pay for what he did to you.

314
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,420
我猜你俩能在那边碰到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I doubt you'll be running in the same circles up there

315
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,990
说不定不能  但是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or wherever, but...

316
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,250
如果你要是遇到他  记得是我们干的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}if you happen to run into him, that was us.

317

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know, I know, you probably have some Bible verse

318
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,220
什么上帝会惩戒恶人之类的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}about leaving revenge to God,

319
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,860
但是埃米特  有的时候你等不到上帝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but, you see, Emmett, sometimes you cannot wait

320
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,680
让全世界和平相处  因为在你等的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}for God to put the world to right because while you're waiting,

321
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,100
世界只会继续暴乱不堪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the world just keeps going to shit.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And when you have a guy like Hood leading the charge,

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}well, God's just gonna have to move a lot faster

324
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,970

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cheers.

327
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,870
你来干什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you doing here?

328
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,640
我想来看看孩子  却发现他们独自在家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I stopped by to see the kids, found them here alone,

329
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,670
所以我决定留下来陪他们吃晚饭
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I decided to stay and have dinner with them.

330
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,980
-蒂法呢  -她早就上床睡觉了  卡莉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Where's Deva? - She went to bed hours ago, Carrie.

331
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,570
-现在都过零点了  -我得通宵加班
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It's past midnight. - I had to work late.

332
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,490
我有时候觉得你根本就没在餐馆里上班
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, somehow I don't think you were at the diner.

333
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,390
许多单身母亲都得打两份工
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, you know, a lot of single mothers have to work two jobs.

334
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,040
别这样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This has to stop.

335
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,860
咱别吵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's not do this.

336
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,660
离婚不就是为了不会再吵架了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Isn't the whole point of getting a divorce so we don't have to fight?

337
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,120
难道你没发现
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How can you not realize that

338
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,400
你没法给孩子们幸福吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you are risking the well-being of your children?

339
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,560
你怎么回事  嗑药了么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it with you? Some sort of addiction or something?

340
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,340
你自己清楚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You would know.

341
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,530
对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry.

342
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,100
所以你和妈不会复合了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you and Mom way back when.

343
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,680
-对  -以后也不可能吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah. - But not anymore?

344
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,040
-是  -你怎么忍心离开她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- No. - How come you left her?

345
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,630
她当时可是怀孕了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, she was pregnant.

346
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,000
她早该去找你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She should have found you.

347
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:28,880
-早该和你说  -不不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- She should have told you. - No, no.

348
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,650
不是她的错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It wasn't her fault.

349
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,100
她不可能不顾自己和你的生命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There was no way she could have got to me

350
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,190
一定要和我在一起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}without putting herself, and you, in a lot of danger.

351
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,400
后来她遇到了你爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then after she met your father,

352
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,740
她所做的事全都是为了你好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}she did what was best for you.

353
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,140
我想说的是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The point is

354
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,640
你才应该和你妈重归于好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}why don't you take it easy on your mom?

355
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,890
她打我生下来就在骗我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She lied to me my whole life.

356
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,850
不  她是想保你安全
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, she tried to keep you safe.

357
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,650
她抛下了一切  她这一辈子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She left everything. Her whole life.

358
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,130
她放弃了一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gave it all up. Everything.

359
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,610
她都是为了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She did that for you.

360
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,500
你什么时候知道我的事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}When did you know about me?

361
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,310
第一次见到你的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The first time I saw you.

362
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,240
你是为她来的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You came here for her?

363
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,040
但我是为你而留下来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I stayed for you.

364
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,080
-爸爸  -我看你不是上床了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hi, Dad. - Hey, I saw you go to bed.

366
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,520
-这样不好  -随你怎么说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- This is not okay. - Yeah, tell me about it.

367
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,370
你在哪找到她的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where'd you find her?

368
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,130
她只是和别的孩子一起在外面玩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She was just out with some other kids.

369
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,790
好吧  谢谢你把她带回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, well, thanks for bringing her back.

370
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,480

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, Carrie promised to tell me everything,

373
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,600
但一旦涉及到你...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but when it came to you...

374
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,520
她就什么都不说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}nothin'.

375
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
不管你的秘密是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whatever your secrets are,

376
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,560
都值得让她不惜对自己的丈夫说谎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}they were worth breaking a promise to her husband.

377
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,290
你毁了我的婚姻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You ended my marriage. Please...

378
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,140
求你不要再缠着我的女儿了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}leave me my daughter.

379
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,210
我不管是谁让她这样的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't care who made her.

380
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,350
我是她...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm her--

381
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,360
我是她父亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm her father.

382
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,250
我求你了

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you check on the club?

391
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,330
我还要在这处理些事情

普罗科特盯上了朗西德的东西
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Proctor had his hands in Longshadow's pockets.

393

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you worried about the Indian?

421
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,240
他早就知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He knew.

422
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,310
他怎么会知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How could he know?

423
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,480
他们当然会怀疑和我有关
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They would naturally suspect my involvement.

424
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,810
谁挑起的对他们来说不重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who pulled the trigger is not important to them.

425
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,660
看来对他来说很重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It seemed pretty important to him.

426
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,180
我会给这里安排个保镖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I'm gonna put a guard in the house.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You just told me his name. How could I have an appointment?

436
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,760
没有许可不能进
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one gets on base without authorization.

437
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,870
今天早些时候有四名陆战队员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There were four Marines killed on the road earlier today,

438
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,770

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, this is a homicide investigation.

444
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,760

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not according to your men at the gate.

445
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,450
他们只是遵守规定而已
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They were just following protocol.

446
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,440
这边走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This way.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Colonel.

448
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,770
我想先告诉你我有多遗憾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me just start by saying how sorry I am.

449
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,650
这是场悲剧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's a tragedy.

450
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,360
加在一起他们在伊拉克和阿富汗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Nine tours in Iraq and Afghanistan

451
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,210
出生入死了九回
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}between 'em,

452
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,120

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and they get killed

453
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,020
演练时被杀了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}demilling an antiquated base in Banshee, Pennsylvania.

454
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,890
我都不知道怎么告诉他们的家人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have no idea how I'm gonna talk their families through that one.

455
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,380
道格拉斯·斯托上校
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Colonel Douglas Stowe.

456
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,300
你们要关闭这里吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you're shutting the place down?

457
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,500
我们只是把这里清理出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're basically clearing house for all the contraband

458
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,890
好存放从战区运来的非法走私品
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that gets shipped out of the war zones.

459
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,650
枪支  贵重物品  毒品  什么都有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Guns, valuables, drugs, you name it.

460
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,210
还有现金
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And cash.

461

你们纳税人的钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your tax dollars at work.

462
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,070
有的用来从街头买枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whether we're buying guns off the streets

463
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,360
以保护他们免受塔利班的侵害
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to keep them from the Taliban

464
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,490
有的就装在文件箱里拿给士兵们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or sending out soldiers with briefcases full of money

465
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,830
去买通线人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to pay off informants.

466
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,140
我们有一半的阿富汗人要养
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We've got half of Afghanistan on the damn payroll.

467
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,940
我们用不掉的钱需要清点记录
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The money we don't use has to be inventoried

468
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,350
送回美联储以备下次战争使用
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and sent back to the Fed to be wasted in the next war.

469
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,240
好吧  但你不赞成
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right. You don't agree?

470
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,410
我不喜欢战争
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't like war.

471
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,940
但是当战斗需要我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But when you ask me to fight,

472
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,600
我就战斗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}let me fight.

473
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,660
那四名被杀的陆战队员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So the four Marines who were killed,

474
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,300
他们是在运送现金吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}they were transporting cash?

475
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,310
不是  我们不用卡车运现金
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, we don't move cash in trucks.

476
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,910
我们会安排装甲车运
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We contract armored vehicles for that.

477
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,240
那些大部分是充公的自动武器
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Those were mostly confiscated automatic weapons.

478
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,660
要运去联邦机构销毁的AK47和M4
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}AKs and M4s headed to a Fed facility to be destroyed.

479
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,380
所以现在红骨帮武装得和塔利班一样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Great, so now the Redbones are armed like the Taliban.

480
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,880
你说什么  红骨帮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry, the Redbones?

481
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,570
那些劫了你们卡车的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The guys who jacked your truck.

482
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,400
他们是居留地的一个部落帮派
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're a tribal gang from the reservation.

483
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,810
你有箱子里装的那些东西的清单吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you have a list of everything that was in those crates?

484
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,590
-我有  -太好了  如果你可以
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I do. - Great, well, if you could

485
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,340
让人帮我把它打印出来...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}just have one of your people print that out for me, then...

486
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,310
胡德警长  很高兴你能来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff Hood, I appreciate the visit

487
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,150
也感谢你和你的下属
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and the fact that you and your deputies

488
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,170
尽全力阻止他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}tried your best to stop these people.

489
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,770
不过他们杀了我的海军陆战队员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the moment they killed my Marines

490
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,160
还偷了政府财产
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and stole government property,

491
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,200
那就变成军事问题了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}this became a matter for the military.

492
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,100
联调局和印第安人事务局
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}NCIS will lead the investigation with

493
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,170
会和海军调查处协调调查的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the FBI and the BIA.

494
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,630
会有很多文件要处理
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, that's a lot of fuckin' letters,

495
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,350
你绝对不想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and the last thing you want

496
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,820
掺和进来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is be getting caught up in the middle of it.

497
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,650
没错  但他们可能会持枪到我的镇上来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's true, but those guns may end up on the streets of my town.

498
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,020
如果真去了  那你请随意反击
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And if they do, you feel free to shoot back.

499
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,250
我们这死了四个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got four dead Marines here.

500
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,040
没有人想跟一个自以为是的警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one's gonna have the patience for a small-town sheriff

501
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,900
浪费时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who thinks he knows better.

502
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,720
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

503
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,640
-那打扰了  -墨菲上校会送你出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Thanks for your time. - Captain Murphy here will show you out.

504
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,070
谢谢你的来访
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks again for coming by.

505
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,970
你看起来不像海军啊  墨菲上校
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't look like a Marine, Captain Murphy.

506
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,660
我是糖果
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sugar here.

507
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,100
还记得我们一直在找的大单子吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know that one big job we've been looking for?

508
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,640
我想我找到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I think I found it.

509
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,530
-说说看  -在海军基地  热那亚基地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Do tell. - The Marine base, Camp Genoa.

510
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,230
他们用货车运现金
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're moving cash by the truckload.

511
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,360
好几百万
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Millions of dollars.

512
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,040
如果在运钱  那说明他们仍配有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If they're moving that kind of money, they're still gonna have

513
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,090
军用级别的安全系统
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}military grade security systems.

514
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,910
是啊  不过咱可认识人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, if only we knew someone

515
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,050
能黑进他们的军用网络
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who could hack into the military network.

516
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,860
已经过了25分钟了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's been 25 minutes.

517
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,400
你应该黑进去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You should be in by now.

518
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,330
你要是被枪指着看你怎么快得起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You try working with a motherfuckin' hand cannon in your face.

519
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,920
这里可是纽约证券交易所
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This here is the New York Stock Exchange.

520
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,070
有很多运行程序
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a lot of moving parts.

521
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,220
那你让它们运行的快点啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then, make them move a little bit faster.

522
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,170
技术讲究的不是黑进去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The trick ain't gettin' in.

523
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,370
而是在神不知鬼不觉中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The trick is gettin' out

524
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,770
已经结束了任务
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}without anyone knowing you've been there.

525
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,350
我对这些没兴趣
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's of no concern to me.

526
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,990
-好了  -搞定了  进去了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- There. - That's it? You're in?

527
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,610
不  不是  只是个信号
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, no, that's just the signal.

528
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,150
信号  什么信号
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Signal? What signal?

529
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,670
我操  他把钱拿走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn it, he got the fuckin' money!

530
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,860
去追啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go get him.

531
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,750
-你看我跑得动么  -见鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Have you seen me run? - Bullshit!

532
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,550
玩脱了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bollocks.

533
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,850
我操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck me!

534
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,140
电话来的真不是时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now is not really a good time.

535
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:46,400
没事吧  事情办得怎么样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything okay? How'd the Fat Al thing go?

536
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,140
全被烧了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Up in fuckin' smoke.

537
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,780
我真的都开始信上帝了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I'm actually starting to believe in God?

538
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,820
而且我觉得那王八蛋不怎么喜欢我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I'm thinkin' that motherfucker hates me.

539
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,990
是的  说个好消息让你高兴一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, well, I got something might cheer you up.

540
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,900
那可不见得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I highly doubt that.

541
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,890
这他妈什么情况  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck, Job?

542
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,110
等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold on.

543
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,600
-这是所有的钱吗  -那个傻逼把自己炸死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Is this all the money? - Motherfucker sat on his own grenade!

544
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,520
我去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn.

545
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,480
我不会回宾夕法尼亚了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I ain't coming back to Pennsylvania.

546
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,880
我刚看到800万到1000万的脏钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just had eyes on eight to ten million in unwashed U.S. Dollars.

547
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,430
你真烦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hate you.

548
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,230
知道吗  你真是讨厌死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know that? I fuckin' hate you.

549
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,800
{\an8}迈尔斯餐厅

550
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,490
你要服务"鸭子王朝"那帮人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I see you met the "Duck Dynasty" Guys.

551
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,430
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

552
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,300
别担心  等他们走了我会给座位消毒的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't worry, I'll sanitize the booth when they leave.

553
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,220
这是你们的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Here you go.

554
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,790
你们想吃点什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What can I get you guys to eat?

555
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,450
一份豪华汉堡和你的电话号码怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How about a deluxe burger and your phone number?

556
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,380
-我没有手机  -没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I don't have a phone. - That's all right.

557
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,820
我们也不需要聊天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We don't have to talk.

558
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,010
你会想把手拿开的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're gonna want to move that hand.

559
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,760
-舒服吗  -耶
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- How's that? - Yeah.

560
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,040
-你觉得爽吗  -当然了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Does that feel good? - Sure does.

561
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,880
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah?

562
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,060
-希望你觉得值得  -什么值得
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hope it was worth it. - Worth what?

563
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,230
汉堡要几成熟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How do you want that burger cooked?

564
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,650
嗨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hi.

565
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,440
发生了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So what happened?

566
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,260
-他摸了我的屁股  -那你就打断了他的鼻子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He grabbed my ass. - So you broke his nose?

567
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,460
你真得觉得自己适合来教育我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you really think you're the right person to be lecturing me?

568
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:36,760
是的  因为我是你现在唯一的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, 'cause right now I'm the only friend you've got.

569
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,720
所以我要再问你一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So I'll ask you one more time.

570
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,720
你怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's going on with you?

571
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,940
我他妈现在在做服务员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm a fucking waitress.

572
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,300
离婚了  孩子们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm getting divorced and my kids look at me

573
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,120
也不认我了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}like they don't know me anymore.

574
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,720
还被近亲繁殖的傻逼乱摸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I'm getting groped by inbred freaks.

575
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,230
他妈的看看我现在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fucking look at me.

576
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:08,930
回家吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go home.

577
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,810
我来搞定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll clean this up.

578
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,750
那么就是它了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So this is the one, huh?

579
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

580
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,700
我也不清楚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know.

581
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,710
一个军事基地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A military base.

582
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,090
听起来挺危险的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sounds risky.

583
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,840
高风险高回报
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anything worthwhile usually is.

584
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,260
而且它已经停止使用了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And it's being decommissioned.

585
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,570
贾伯怎么说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What about Job?

586
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,560
他说他会考虑的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He said he'd think about it.

587
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,680
我觉得他不会回来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't think he's coming back here.

588
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,550
看看你  糖果
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look at you, Sugar,

589
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,880
已经在试着排挤我了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}already trying to cut me out.

590
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,800
那是你开车时的打扮吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that your driving outfit?

591
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,320
是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, it is.

592
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,370
而且幸运的是它也是"别惹我"的打扮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And fortunately it's also my "Don't take any shit" outfit.

593
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:54,190
所以不管你想要说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So whatever it is you thinking about sayin',

594
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,680
咽下去再给我倒杯他妈的威士忌
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}swallow it and pour me a fuckin' whiskey.

595
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,270
如果我现在就开始喝了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I start drinkin' now,

596
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:03,960
也许我会醉到可以在白天面对这镇子了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}maybe I'll be drunk enough to handle this town in daylight.

597
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,070
先生们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gentlemen...

598
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,820
敬热那亚基地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Camp Genoa.

599
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,790
敬热那亚基地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Camp Genoa.

600
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,520
在我来这里的路上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, my whole way over here,

601
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,330
我一直在想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just kept thinking,

602
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:26,740
我不敢相信我会回到这个狗屁地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}"I can't believe I'm coming back to this shithole

603
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,830
和他妈的海军陆战队交手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to mix it up with the fuckin' Marines."

604
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:32,250
我担心的不是海军陆战队
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it's not the Marines I'm worried about.

605
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,270
-我担心的是赏金猎人  -赏金猎人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It's the mercs. - The mercs?

606
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:37,110
你他妈跟本就没说这事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You didn't say nothing about no motherfuck--

607
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,580
什么样的赏金猎人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}what kind of mercs?

608
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,620
很坏的那种
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, the bad kind.

609
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,520
如果要我猜的话应该是前海豹突击队的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'd say ex-Navy SEALs if I had to guess.

610
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,050
我才不信这狗屁呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't believe this shit.

611
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,050
你怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What is it with you?

612
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:50,940
你想找死吗  是这样吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is it a death wish? Is that what it is?

613
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,750
如果是这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Because if it is,

614
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,100
你干嘛不自己出去然后自杀呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}why don't you go out and get yourself killed?

615
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,530
你为什么老让我和你一起送命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why do you always want to get me killed with you?

616
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,280
-很多钱的  -对手是他妈的全副武装的士兵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It's a lot of money. - It's fucking soldiers with guns.

617
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,950
他妈的重型武器  我们不是在说保镖
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Big fucking guns. We ain't talking about rent-a-cops.

618
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,390
也不是在说警察
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We ain't even talkin' about real cops.

619
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,550
我们谈论的是他妈的突击队
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We talkin' about fuckin' commandos.

620
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,920
-他们不会发现  -打住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- They'll never see us com-- - Uh-uh, nope!

621
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,390
还是说说钱的事儿吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me about the money.
