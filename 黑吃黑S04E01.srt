00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,370
我是布罗克
This is Brock.

2
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,450
有间很老的狩猎小屋
There's an old hunting cabin up here.

3
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,620
我去看看
I'm gonna go check it out.

4
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,900
收到
Copy.

5
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,740
你要等待支援吗
Do you want to wait for backup?

6
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,440
不用  看起来没人
Negative. Looks abandoned.

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,910
我操
Holy shit.

8
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,640
胡德
Hood.

9
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,120
黑吃黑

10
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,120
第四季
第一集

11
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,850
你怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

12
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,200
我没有
I didn't.

13
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,880
我是说  我不是在找你
I mean, I wasn't looking for you.

14
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,990
我以为你远走高飞了
I thought you were gone.

15
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,660
嘿  帮帮忙
Hey, you want to do me a favor

16
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,370
别拿那玩意儿指着我行吗
and point that thing somewhere else, okay?

17
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,850
天啊
Holy hell.

18
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,030
两年没见了
Haven't seen you in two years.

19
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,090
你一直住这小屋里
And all that time you've been living up in this cabin

20
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,620
跟野人一样吗
like some kind of mountain man or something?

21
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,850
有人跟你一起吗
Is there anybody here with you?

22
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,530
没有
No.

23
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,920
那你需要跟我走
Then I'm gonna need you to come with me.

24
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,790
不要
No.

25
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,480
我不是请求你
I'm not asking.

26
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,750
-洛特斯警长  -没错
- Sheriff Lotus. - That's right.

27
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,850
感觉如何
How does that feel?

28
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,880
跟痔疮一样
Like a hemorrhoid.

29
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,360
要告诉我是怎么了吗
You want to tell me what this is about?

30
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,840
回局里告诉你
I'll tell you down at the station.

31
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,480
你是指凯迪吗
You mean the Cadi?

32
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,610
不  我不是指那里
No. No, I don't.

33
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,490
女妖镇欢迎你  请小心驾驶

34
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:05,460
女妖镇警局

35
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,140
你觉得如何
What do you think?

36
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,210
防弹玻璃
Bulletproof glass.

37
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,700
1.5英寸厚的聚碳酸酯
One-and-a-half- inch-thick polycarb.

38
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
你应该会喜欢
Thought you'd like that.

39
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,570
斯格特  指纹检查结果你拿到后马上给我
Scott, I need those fingerprint results as soon as you get them.

40
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,930
-好的  -谢谢
- Sure. - Thanks.

41
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,740
我要知道记者会的事
I need to know about the press conference.

42
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,810
邦克  还记得胡德先生吗
Bunker, you remember Mr. Hood?

43
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,130
妮娜·克鲁兹副警长
Deputy Nina Cruz.

44
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,310
比利·雷文升职了  他是奇诺警署的新警长
Billy Raven moved on. He's the new chief of the Kinaho PD.

45
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,450
-警长  -海伦  有留言吗
- Sheriff. - Helen, any messages?

46
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,430
在您桌子上
On your desk.

47
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,250
-联调局那边呢  -还没有回应
- Oh, the FBI? - Not yet.

48
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,960
-办公室不错  -是的
- Nice office. - Yes, it is.

49
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,340
你要喝点什么吗
Can I get you something to drink?

50
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,580
我这里有水  咖啡  我这里有台咖啡机
I got water, coffee. I've got this espresso machine here.

51
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,950
坐吧
Have a seat.

52
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,930
首先  你需要知道
First of all, you should know

53
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,340
我今天去那里时
when I went up there today,

54
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,540
根本没想到会找到你
you were the last person I expected to find.

55
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,180
两天前你在那个小屋里吗
Were you in that cabin two nights ago?

56
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,400
在
Yes.

57
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,620
-还有别人吗  -没有
- Anybody with you? - No.

58
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,300
谁死了
Who's dead?

59
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:57,870
那是谁
Who is that?

60
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,250
丽贝卡
Rebecca.

61
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,660
她的尸体昨天在河边发现
Her body was found yesterday near the river.

62
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,720
她不是在那儿遇害的
That's not where she was killed,

63
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,420
但尸体被抛在了那里
but that's where the body was dumped.

64
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,410
天啊
Jesus.

65
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,400
这是今年发生的第三起类似谋杀案了
This is the third murder of its kind that we've had this year.

66
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,660
-你通知了联调局  -对
- You call the FBI? - Yeah.

67
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,530
第二起发生后我就通知了
I called them after the second one

68
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,080
他们派了一个小混蛋过来
and they sent some little shit up here

69
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,840
他看了我们的档案  做了些笔记
and he looked through our files and took some notes

70
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,960
然后就赶着投胎似的
and then he ran back to Quantico

71
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,480
踩着60块的破鞋跑回了匡蒂科
as fast as his little $60 loafers could take him.

72
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,810
告诉我如果发生第三起再打电话过去
Told me to call back if a third body turned up.

73
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,250
所以现在他们可能会重视了
So maybe now they'll give a shit.

74
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,030
那这跟我有什么关系
So what does this have to do with me?

75
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,710
你最后一次见丽贝卡是什么时候
When was the last time you saw Rebecca?

76
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,200
我已经有18个月
I haven't seen anyone

77
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,470
没见过别人了
for about 18 months.

78
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,830
但这就奇怪了
And yet, it's the weird part,

79
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,320
是她车载GPS最后的定位
the last coordinates on her car's GPS

80
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,770
今天把我带到了你的小屋
brought me up to your cabin today.

81
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,860
-你没见到她  -没有
- You didn't see her? - Nope.

82
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,850
你知道她为什么要来找你吗
Any idea why she'd come looking for you?

83
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,050
她怎么会知道你在那里  胡德
How the hell she'd even know you were up there, Hood?

84
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,280
我只想捋清楚这事
I'm just trying to put this together.

85
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,630
-那是她叔叔的地  -那是什么
- It's her uncle's land. - It's what?

86
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,170
那是她叔叔的地
It's her uncle's land.

87
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,390
你住在普罗科特的地方
You're living on Proctor's land?

88
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,440
他不知道
He doesn't know.

89
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,290
你遇到什么事了  胡德
What happened to you, Hood?

90
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,530
我退休了
I retired.

91
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,100
我们发现了少量与丽贝卡血型不符的血迹
We found trace blood that didn't match Rebecca's.

92
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,610
我需要你自愿提供一份血样
I'm gonna need you to voluntarily submit a blood sample

93
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,510
供我们排除嫌疑
so we can rule you out.

94
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,210
你现在怀疑我是连环杀人犯了
You think I'm a fucking serial killer now?

95
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,920
你最近照过镜子吗  胡德
Have you seen yourself lately, Hood?

96
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,810
你住在树林里
You're living up in the woods.

97
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,350
看起来像个炸弹杀手
You look like the Unabomber.

98
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,660
-好  我可以提供血样  -还有  胡德
- Yes, you can have my blood. - Oh, and, Hood...

99
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,420
如果还有什么想告诉我的
If there's anything else you want to tell me,

100
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,270
就现在说吧
now's the time.

101
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,190
你应该盯着点普罗科特
You should be looking at Proctor.

102
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,090
是  但现在这事更复杂了
Yeah, well, these days that's a little more complicated.

103
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,950
他...
He's--

104
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,480
进来
Yeah?

105
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,440
媒体见面会要开始了
Press conference is about to start.

106
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,520
该死  好吧好吧
Oh, shit, yeah, yeah.

107
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,590
-知道了  -胡德警长
- Okay. - Sheriff Hood.

108
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,020
他不是警长
He's not the sheriff.

109
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,460
听着  我会让克鲁兹副警长来给你采血
Listen, I'll have Deputy Cruz come up and take your blood

110
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,580
然后她会送你回去
and then she'll give you a lift back.

111
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,660
你多保重
Take care of yourself.

112
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,310
怎么称呼
And you are?

113
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,770
有什么问题吗
Is there something wrong?

114
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,850
抱歉  你只是...
Sorry, you just--

115
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,460
刚才有个瞬间  你让我想起了一个人
you reminded me of someone for a moment.

116
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,590
被杀的副警长吗
Mmm, the deputy who got killed?

117
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,650
印第安小混混把她的脖子扭断了
Indian gangbanger broke her neck?

118
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,520
你不说话的时候我更喜欢你
I think I like you better when you don't talk.

119
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,320
先生  先生
Sir. Sir.

120
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,460
到时间了
It's time.

121
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,920
市长先生  这是今年第三起
Mr. Mayor, this is the third murder

122
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,240
针对年轻女性的谋杀案了
of a young woman this year.

123
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,760
这是个连环杀手吗
Is this a serial killer?

124
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,290
最近的受害人真的是您侄女吗
Is it true that the latest victim was your niece?

125
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,110
市长先生  为什么警方迟迟不发布公告
Mr. Mayor, why are the police reports being withheld?

126
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,770
据我们所知
Here's...here's what we know.

127
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,990
据我们所知
Here's what we know.

128

但这个案件与过去一年内发生的
there are definitely similarities between this case

137
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,610
两起年轻女子被杀案
and the murders of two other young women

138
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,260
确实有相似之处
that occurred over the last year.

139
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,370
女妖镇警局已经联系了联调局
The Banshee Sheriff's Department has notified the FBI

141
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,870
探员们正在前来协助调查的路上
and agents are en route to assist in the investigation.

142
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,270
关于你的问题
And to answer your question,

143
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,490
没错  丽贝卡是我的侄女
yes, Rebecca was my niece.

144
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,010
还有  是的  你们可以放心
And, yes, you can rest assured

145
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,590
我  洛特斯警长  还有他局里的人
that neither I nor Sheriff Lotus

146
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,710
不找到这个病态又扭曲的混蛋
and the members of his department will rest

147
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,630
绝不会罢休
until we have found this sick, twisted bastard.

148
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,180
十二个月前

149
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,130
就是这里吗
So this is it?

150
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,260
对  就是这里
Yes, this is it.

151
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,350
真漂亮
It's beautiful.

152
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,160
我将成为市长
I'm going to be mayor

153
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,540
而生意上你要多管一点
and you're taking on more of a leadership role in the business.

154
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,060
我只是觉得我们需要多一层保障
I just figured we'd need something a bit more secure.

155
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,390
你喜欢这里吗
Do you like it?

156
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,320
太爱了
I love it.

157
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,300
出来
Get out.

158
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,090
怎么回事
What's going on?

159
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,820
地方检察官撤回起诉了  你可以走了
DA dismissed the charges. You're free to go.

160
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,830
你在耍我们
You're fucking with us.

161
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,170
过十秒你再不走  我就把门关上
You got 10 seconds before I close that door again.

162
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,310
我就知道你们不该抓我
I knew that arrest was bullshit.

163
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,120
这次又怎么了
What was it this time?

164
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,250
物证
Physical evidence.

165
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,090
他们差一点勒死那个老头
They practically strangled that old man.

166
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,720
我知道  地方检察官太有才了
I know. DA's a real piece of work.

167
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,930
他就是个傀儡
He's a puppet.

168
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,380
普罗科特操控着他
Proctor's got his hand up his ass.

169
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,210
下次再说这事
But that's a talk for another time.

170
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,090
隔墙有耳
The walls have ears.

171
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,740
非常感谢  警官  祝你愉快
Hey, thanks a lot, Officer. Have a nice evening.

172
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,020
我总是禁不住在想他
There's always some part of me that's thinking about him.

173
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,540
他死时的样子
How he looked when he died.

174
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,270
他看着我时的样子
How he looked at me.

175
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,180
有时候那段记忆会困扰我
There are days when that look haunts me

176
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,290
以至于无法呼吸
so badly I can barely breathe.

177
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,890
嘿  看那里
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at this.

178
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,390
有时我可以让自己分心不去想
And then there are days when I can distract myself.

179
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,010
你迷路了吗  宝贝
You lost, honey?

180
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,190
我可以屏蔽所有的噪音
Where I can shut off all the noise.

181
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,740
也许我们可以帮你
Maybe we can help you find your way.

182
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,490
那最好了
Oh, I hope so.

183
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,730
我只做我需要做的事
And just do what I have to do.

184
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,420
那样的日子就挺好
Those are the good days.

185
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,920
你们这些壮汉喜欢欺负人  是吧
So you tough guys like beating up on people, huh?

186
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,560
不是我们干的  警察让我们走了
It wasn't us. They let us go.

187
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,980
他们真不应该
Well, they shouldn't have.

188
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,930
有时当我刚醒来时总会觉得
There's always that moment when I just wake up

189
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,770
自己还在那里
where I think I'm still there,

190
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,330
在我们的老房子里
still back there in our old house.

191
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,820
但我转过身时
And when I roll over,

192
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,800
戈登会在我身边躺着
Gordon will be there lying next to me.

193
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,900
然后我会听见孩子们在他们的房间打闹
And then I'll hear the kids stirring in their rooms.

194
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,480
你是如何解压的呢
So how do you handle it?

195
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,510
锻炼
I exercise.

196
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,240
吃些东西
I eat something.

197
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,400
开始打理房子
I start working on the house.

198
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,220
房子如何能帮到你
How's the house coming along?

199
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,890
我做手工时
There's something about working with my hands

200
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,110
可以得到宁静
that gives me peace.

201
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,390
还有什么让你平静
What else gives you peace?

202
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,350
没什么了
Not much.

203
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,880
你觉得这个疗程有用吗
Do you find our sessions helpful?

204
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,630
我来这里只是因为是法庭强制的
I'm here because it's court-mandated.

205
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,830
无意冒犯
No offense.

206
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,250
没事
None taken.

207
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,800
如果我今天担保了你抚养孩子的资格
If I vouch for your competency to parent your children today,

208
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,340
你还会再来吗
would you come back?

209
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,030
如果我说是你会那么做吗
If I said yes, would you do that?

210
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,720
事情其实不是这样的
That's not really how it works.

211
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,490
他们无权带走我的孩子们
They had no right to take my kids away.

212
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,240
你违反了缓刑期的条例
You violated the terms of your probation.

213
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,090
我被挟持了
I was abducted.

214
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,720
军方的调查已经澄清了
The military investigation cleared us.

215
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,470
任何和犯罪有关的要素
Any association with the criminal element

216
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,310
-对于社会福利部门已经足够  -我知道
- was enough for social services - I know.

217
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,820
我知道
I know.

218
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,080
十七个月前

219
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,320
你要毁了我们的生活多少次
How many times are you gonna ruin our lives?

220
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,280
从今以后  你只是把我妈肚子搞大的混蛋
From now on, you're just the asshole who knocked up my mom.

221
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,780
求你了
Please.

222
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,810
你来干嘛
What are you doing here?

223
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,370
经理告诉我我们的前警长在酗酒
The manager told me our former sheriff was on a bender.

224
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,140
搞乱房间
Trashing the room.

225
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,330
玩枪
Playing with guns.

226
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,090
关你什么事
How is that your business?

227
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,510
这是我叔叔的汽车旅馆
It's my uncle's motel.

228
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,420
让我一个人待着  可以吗
Just leave me alone, would you?

229
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,760
快滚开  滚
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

230
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,010
求你走吧
Please go.

231
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,920
你不能待在这里
You can't stay here.

232
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,790
我带你回你家吧
Let me take you back to your place.

233
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,960
不  我再不能住那里了
No, I can't live there anymore.

234
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,360
那有鬼魂
There's ghosts.

235
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,740
这地方都被你弄成这样  没法住了
Even before you wrecked it, this dump is nowhere to live.

236
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,510
来吧  带你去个地方
Come on. Let's go for a ride.

237
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,430
这是个旧的狩猎木屋
It's an old hunting cabin.

238
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,350
很多年没用了  但还通水
Hasn't been used in years, but the water still runs.

239
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,660
这屋子是谁的
Whose is it?

240
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,710
你觉得是谁的
Who do you think?

241
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,070
你真觉得你叔叔会让我住在这里吗
You really think your uncle is gonna let me stay here?

242
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,530
他不会知道的
He won't know.

243
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,130
喜欢这里吗
How do you like it?

244
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,750
是的
Yeah.

245
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,680
就知道你会喜欢
I thought you would.

246
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,100
没有鬼魂
No ghosts.

247
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,340
-这里痛吗  -现在不了
- Does this hurt? - Not anymore.

248
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,390
我讨厌他们对你这么做
I hate that they did this to you.

249
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,750
反正我早就想弄掉这个纹身了
I had been meaning to get that tattoo removed anyway.

250
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,660
真希望可以永远这样
Just wish it could always be like this.

251
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,830
也许某天会的
Maybe one day.

252
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,230
你还好吗
You okay?

253
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,380
不
No.

254
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,840
站那儿别动  他马上就出来
Hang on right there. He'll be with you in a moment.

255
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,800
贱货
You fuck.

256
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,930
我们和红骨帮有严格的协议
We have a strict agreement with the Redbones.

257
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,620
你们在居留地里做生意
You keep your business on the reservation

258
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,560
我们也不会越界
and we keep ours off it.

259
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,920
你们违反了协议
You are in breach of that agreement.

260
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,540
什么事
Yeah?

261
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,230
我才刚开始工作  该死
I just got to work, for fuck's sake.

262
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,900
谁在那
Who's there?

263
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,660
靠
Shit.

264
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,190
不  好  什么事都别做
No. Okay. Don't do a fucking thing.

265
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,710
我马上回去
I'm coming back to town.

266
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,780
你可以自己问他
Well, you can ask him yourself.

267
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,750
这里一切都进展得很顺利
Things are going fantastic over here.

268
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,590
这次你请客  好的
This time you're buying. Okay.

269
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,400
行  行  行
All right, all right, all right.

270
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,790
很好  帮我向卡罗尔问好
Great. Say hi to Carol for me.

271
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:02,140
好啊  加尔文  有什么能帮到你的吗
Hey there, Calvin. What can I do you for?

272
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,230
我身体不太舒服  我需要回家
I'm not feeling great. I'm gonna need to go home.

273
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,240
-你看着挺好的啊  -我胃痛
- You look fine. - I've got a stomach bug.

274
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,080
我以为我能熬过今天  可我不行
I thought I could make it through the day, but I can't.

275
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,660
你负责三季刊  是吧
You're handling the triquarterlies, aren't you?

276
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,780
弄完了吗
They done?

277
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,850
还没
Not yet, no.

278
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,640
我今天就要
Kind of need those done today.

279
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,930
我可以带回家做
Well, I can take them home with me

280
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,700
明天一大早就交给你
and I'll have them done for you first thing tomorrow.

281
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,940
上个季度我们也迟了  对吗
We were late with them last quarter, too, weren't we?

282
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,170
没有吧
I don't think so, no.

283
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,720
我觉得有  加尔文
I think we were, Calvin.

284
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,680
我操你妈
Gook motherfucker!

285
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,750
明天一大早就给你
I'll have those to you first thing tomorrow.

286
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,850
他在这做什么
What the fuck is he doing here?

287
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,170
我们进来就看到他
We came in and found him here

288
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,290
还有这个被夹在虎头钳里的贱逼
with this motherfucker already in the vise.

289
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,860
他在我们的地盘上贩毒
He was dealing in our territory.

290
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:43,100
而地盘属于你和你手下的保护范畴
The territory you and your men are charged with protecting.

291
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,990
出于礼节我才把他带过来的
I brought him here as a courtesy.

292
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,130
我缴的税还不够
So my tax dollars aren't enough

293
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,630
你和你的部落用  是吗
for you and your little tribe, huh?

294
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,910
你们这群混蛋还要来侵犯我的生意
Now you fuckers are going to encroach on my business?

295
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,370
操你妈
Fuck you.

296
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,700
我可不这么认为
I don't think so.

297
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,690
我们为你们的住所
We pay for your houses...

298
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,690
你们的居留地
for your damn reservations,

299
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,410
你们的学校  你们的医保付钱
for your school, and your health care,

300
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,140
即使你们所有人
even when all of you were

301
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,190
都靠着赌场赚得盆满钵满  对吗
getting rich off your fucking casinos, right?

302
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,900
这个国家已经没了骨气
This country has lost its spine.

303
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,610
政治家把它给了一群蠢货和杂种
The politicians are giving it away to the mutts and the mongrels

304
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,830
而纯种美国人却只能挨饿
while good, pure-blooded Americans go hungry.

305
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,040
这已经不是一个国家了
This isn't a nation anymore.

306
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,320
而是他妈的施舍处
It's a fucking soup kitchen.

307
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,600
知道吗
And you know what?

308
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,630
我们都他妈没粥了
We're all out of fucking soup!

309
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,050
谢谢提醒
Thanks for the heads up.

310
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,680
你可以告诉普罗科特一切尽在掌控之中
You can tell Proctor that we've got it under control.

311
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,400
别在外人面前提他的名字
Don't use his name in front of outsiders.

312
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,300
他吗
Him?

313
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,070
他应该没有怎么注意
Yeah, I don't think he's paying too much attention.

314
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,030
你不会希望我再回到这的
You don't want me to come back here.

315
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,880
戴维斯酒馆

316
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,360
嘿  糖果
Hey, Sugar.

317
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,490
你消失了一年半
You disappear for a year and a half...

318
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,310
又像《圣经》里的神迹一样
you show up here looking like...

319
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,910
出现在这里
something out of the Bible,

320
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,240
而你能说的只有
and all you got to say for yourself is

321
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,840
"嘿  糖果"
"Hey, Sugar"?

322
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,390
你过得怎样
How you been?

323
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,670
跟我闲扯  闹呢
Small talk? Seriously?

324
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,490
有人杀了丽贝卡·鲍曼
Somebody killed Rebecca Bowman.

325
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,920
我知道
I know that.

326
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,140
这里所有人都知道
Everybody around here knows that.

327
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,460
但你怎么会知道
Now why do you know that?

328
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,580
这个...
Well...

329
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,650
我被当做嫌犯了
I guess I'm a suspect.

330
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,560
是你做的吗
Did you do it?

331
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,180
不是
No.

332
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,650
不能怪别人怀疑你
Look, it's a fair question.

333
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,310
看看你这样子
I mean, look at yourself.

334
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,370
你到底去哪里了
Where the hell have you been?

335
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,380
我得消失一段时间
I had to disappear for a while.

336
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,410
让头脑放空
Clear my head.

337
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,960
几天时间就能放空
You clear your head for a few days.

338
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,840
或许一周
A week maybe.

339
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,190
对你  可能要一个月
For you, maybe even a month.

340
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,070
可你却当了逃兵
But you, you went AWOL

341
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,660
忘了你的朋友  忘了你的...
and you forgot about your friends and you forgot about--

342
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,330
我没忘了贾伯
I didn't forget about Job.

343
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,210
你他妈躲起来对他有什么帮助
How the fuck was hiding away gonna help him?

344
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,130
你是来这里拿钱的
You here for your money?

345
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,610
不是
No.

346
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,970
但我需要一辆车
But I do need a car.

347
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,670
我只买了这个
Only thing I bought.

348
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,600
想着迅速逃离的话离会派上用场
Figured it might come in handy if I ever needed a quick exit.

349
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,470
现在怎么办
So what happens now?

350
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,740
不知道
I don't know.

351
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,010
但肯定会做点什么吧
But something, right?

352
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,720
对
Yeah.

353
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,010
做点什么
Something.

354
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,440
记住  胡德  你不是警长了
Remember, Hood, you're not the sheriff anymore.

355
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,290
我从来都不是
I never was.

356
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:33,950
你懂我的意思
You know what I mean.

357
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,420
那人长什么样
What'd the other guy look like?

358
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,620
真他妈好笑
Very fucking funny.

359
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,320
其实我没开玩笑
Actually, I wasn't kidding.

360
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,500
他长什么样
What did he look like?

361
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,810
他看着像个妈的混蛋
He looked like a fucking asshole

362
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,810
把我手砸个稀巴烂的混蛋
smashing the shit out of my hands.

363
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,560
那家伙揍了你那么久
The guy stuck around long enough to walk all over your face

364
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,730
你都没看清吗
and you didn't even get a look?

365
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,030
那里很黑
It was dark.

366
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,510
没关系
Don't worry.

367
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,900
我有的是时间
I got time.

368
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,470
你回来了
You're back.

369
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,830
瑞贝卡的事我很难过
I'm sorry about Rebecca.

370
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,420
这和你有什么关系
What does this have to do with you?

371
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,780
没啥关系
Nothing.

372
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,690
那你怎么来了
And yet here you are.

373
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,460
有什么要告诉我的吗
Is there anything I should know?

374
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,320
你舅舅  他不是个好人
Your uncle, he's not a good man.

375
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,710
那让我和你住
Well, then let me live with you.

376
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,390
我也不是好人
I'm not a good man either.

377
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,720
我也想这么问你
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

378
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,630
你觉得我跟我侄女的死有关
You think I had anything to do with my niece's death?

379
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:54,010
可能不是你杀的  但他妈的是你害死了她
You may not have killed her, but you sure as shit got her killed.

380
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,890
你把她牵扯进来  迟早害死她
As soon as you took her in, it was only a matter of time.

381
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,820
对
Yeah.

382
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,980
你也许说得对
You may be right.

383
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,890
我会找到那个混蛋
I'm gonna find that son of a bitch.

384
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,200
可作为市长
But as a mayor,

385
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,060
要澄清真相却有点力不从心
I'm somewhat hampered in my ability to clarify matters.

386
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,140
你是怎么当上的
How'd you pull that off?

387
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,270
-因为没有对手  -想到了
- I ran unopposed. - Of course.

388
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,030
你会从哪查起
Where would you start?

389
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,190
从山麓的博迪克家族开始
The foothills. The Boedickers.

390
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,890
我听说他们家被烧光了
I heard they got burned down.

391
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,500
没错  可亚伦·博迪克还活着
It's true, but Aaron Boedicker is still alive.

392
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,080
你们没看到黄色警戒带吗
You guys, you did see the yellow tape here, right?

393
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,900
-警长  -没关系
- Sheriff. - It's fine.

394
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,360
这里的调查结束了
Our work is done here.

395
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,640
你在跟踪我吗  布罗克
You following me, Brock?

396
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,980
我  不  跟踪是我下属的活
Me? No. That's what deputies are for.

397
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,890
胡德是嫌犯吗
Is Hood a suspect?

398
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:02,210
他如果是  你肯定第一个知道吧
Well, if he was, you'd be the first to know it, wouldn't you?

399
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,210
不  胡德先生是本案的嫌疑人
No, Mr. Hood is a person of interest in this case,

400
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,300
而你俩都有嫌疑
which is something you two have in common.

401
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,430
警长  多加小心
Be careful, Sheriff.

402
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,910
我一直如此  市长先生
I always am, Mr. Mayor.

403
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,140
感觉又回到从前了吧
Just like old times, huh?

404
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,210
只是这次没人受伤
Except no one's bleeding.

405
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,410
还没而已
Yet.

406
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,130
柯特
Hey, Kurt.

407
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,250
别这样好吗  你打算一直无视我吗
Come on, bro. How long you gonna keep this up, man?

408
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,400
我可救了你一命  柯特
I saved your fucking life, Kurt.

409
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,360
要是瓦茨会怎么做
What do you think Watts would have done?

410
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,710
他一定会毙了你
He would have had you executed.

411
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,890
但我先发制人了
I took action before he could order it, that's it.

412
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,710
我在烧伤监护病房住了两个月
I was in the burn unit for two months.

413
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,770
我明白  我很抱歉
I know and I'm sorry,

414
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,750
但是你让我身处绝境
but you put me in an impossible situation

415
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,670
我必须表忠心啊
and I had to prove my loyalty to the cause.

416
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,830
你明白的
You know that.

417
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,020
来一块吃晚餐吧
Just come for dinner, man.

418
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,460
玛吉很希望你能来
Maggie would really love to see you.

419
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,290
我们也能好好谈谈
And we can work this out.

420
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,910
你总是说  再亲亲不过亲兄弟
Brothers before Brotherhood, that's what you always said.

421
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,540
我没有你这样的兄弟
You're not my brother.

422
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,980
什么  你他妈刚才说什么
What? What the fuck did you just say to me?

423
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:35,150
我是你和他们唯一的中间人  蠢货
I'm the only thing standing between them and you, asshole.

424
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,280
你最好给我记住了
You better fucking remember that!

425
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,190
-凯莉  -布罗克
- Hey, Carrie. - Hey, Brock.

426
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,850
开始有点样子了嘛
Wow, place is really starting to come together.

427
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,420
-谢谢  -不用  真挺好的
- Thanks. - No, looks good.

428
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,830
孩子们怎么样
How are the kids doing?

429
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,210
就那样吧  戈登的父母快把他们逼疯了
Oh, you know. Gordon's parents are driving them crazy.

430
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,990
有事吗  布罗克
Something on your mind, Brock?

431
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:45,040
那个  凯莉  不知道你听说没
Listen, Carrie, I don't know if you've heard, but...

432
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,280
胡德回来了
Hood is back.

433
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,590
看样子你应该不知道
Guess you haven't heard.

434
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,700
他一直住在山麓的一个小屋里
He's been living up in the foothills in a cabin.

435
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,810
他看上去很糟
He-- he looks rough.

436
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,090
我觉得你可能想知道
Just thought you'd want to know.

437
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,270
所以说一声
Yeah.

438
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,150
有事给我打电话  好吗
Call me if you need anything, all right?

439
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,030
好的
Okay.

440
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,510
-祝你今天过得开心  -谢谢
- Have a good day. - Thanks.

441
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,010
十八个月前

442
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,990
路易斯  一切正常吗
Lewis, is everything okay?

443
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,820
路易斯  请回答
Lewis, come in.

444
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,390
他妈的别动
Don't fucking move.

445
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,520
有什么好笑的
Something funny?

446
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,590
稍等片刻
Wait for it.

447
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,080
放下武器
Drop it!

448
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,180
是你
You.

449
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:53,880
正是
Me.

450
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,490
好久不见啊
Long time, huh?

451
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,340
坐下说如何
Why don't you take a seat?

452
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,420
这么多年你终于找到我了
You finally tracked me down after all these years.

453
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,180
你是谁
Who are you?

454
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,260
我叫道尔顿
My name is Dalton.

455
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,800
-你是当兵的  -曾经是
- Are you military? - I was.

456
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,390
现在我们招募你这样的人
But now I recruit men like you.

457
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,400
培养他们成为精英队
I develop them for an elite unit.

458
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,530
什么队
What unit?

459
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,410
哪支部队的
What branch?

460
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,310
没错
Exactly.

461
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,690
那么
So...

462
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:35,690
这是复仇吗
this is revenge?

463
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,900
复仇
Revenge?

464
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:39,700
不算是
Not really.

465
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,100
贾伯在哪
Where's Job?

466
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,560
我他妈怎么知道
How the fuck would I know?

467
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,760
别这样  你知道套路的
No, no, no, no. You know how this works.

468
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,800
都是你教我的
You taught me.

469
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,650
手肘  脚背  膝盖
Elbows, insteps, knees.

470
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,460
我可以折磨你好几天
I can keep you alive for fucking days.

471
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,710
所以我要知道他在哪肯定会告诉你
I know, which is why if I knew something, I would tell you.

472
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,990
-胡说  -他不是我抓的
- Bullshit. - I didn't take him.

473
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,080
但抓他的人知道我想要他
But the man who did knew I would want him.

474
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,720
我付钱  他交出贾伯
I paid him his price and he handed over Job.

475
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,620
然后呢
Then what?

476
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,810
我把他交出去了
I turned him in.

477
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,030
我跟当权者两清了
I cleaned my slate with the powers that be.

478
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,290
-他们是谁  -得了吧
- And who are they? - Oh, come on.

479
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,770
别他妈装傻  你知道套路的
Don't be a fucking idiot. You know how this works.

480
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,870
名字和真人永远对不上号
Faces without names. Names without faces.

481
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,510
来吧  继续冲我左膝开枪吧
Go ahead. Go ahead shoot my left knee.

482
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,680
你知道这改变不了我说的事实
You know that it won't change what I'm saying.

483
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,570
我真不知道他们把他带到哪去了
I have no idea where they took him.

484
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,030
对  但你能找到他
No, but you can find him.

485
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,380
地下监狱  幽灵拘留所
Black sites, ghost detention centers.

486
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,980
你能拿到那些文件
You have access to those files.

487
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,600
已经不行了  国会听证会以后
Not anymore. After the congressional hearings,

488
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,410
圈子已经关上了  我不再是圈内人了
they closed the loop and I'm not in it.

489
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,190
胡扯  你就是圈内的重要人物
Bullshit. You are the fucking loop.

490
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,110
我以前是  20年前是
I was. That was 20 years ago.

491
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,550
今非昔比
Things change.

492
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,290
我们还说这事干什么
Why are we even having this conversation?

493
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,610
你明知贾伯已经死了
You know that Job is already dead.

494
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,240
不会  他有情报
No, he has intelligence.

495
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,510
-他是个重要线人 -20年前的情报
- He's a valuable asset. - His intelligence was 20 years old.

496
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,500
他是众人觊觎的战利品
He was a fucking trophy grab.

497
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,420
-被人用来炫耀的摆设  -被谁炫耀
- He was a head on somebody's wall. - Whose wall?

498
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,820
不重要了
Doesn't matter.

499
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:11,920
他已经死了
The man's dead.

500
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,890
你我心知肚明
You know it and I know it.

501
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,120
我们得走了
We got to go.

502
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,570
得赶紧走了
We got to go now.

503
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,680
看来我在圈子里还有些关系
I guess I'm still in certain loops.

504
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,810
快  快  快
Go, go, go.

505
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,490
他来找你了吗
Did he come to see you?

506
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,140
是
Yes.

507
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,930
但他已经不是那晚离开时的他了
But he's not the man that left that night.

508
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,800
不再是了
Not anymore.

509
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,160
他说他去哪了吗
Well, did he say where he's been?

510
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,510
没有
No.

511
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,190
那他说什么了吗
Did he say anything?

512
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,190
你认为他可能有贾伯的线索
You thought he might have a lead on Job?

513
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,030
听着  从他离开开始
Look, the day he left,

514
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:59,440
你就不该再期望能从他身上
that was the day you needed to stop looking to him

515
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:01,170
找到任何答案
for any answers.

516
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,760
你觉得贾伯还活着吗
You think Job's still alive?

517
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,870
我不知道
I don't know.

518
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,640
有时候我希望他死了
Sometimes I hope he isn't.

519
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,130
为什么
Why?

520
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,440
因为如果他还活着
Because if he is,

521
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,420
会让我们感觉自己更混蛋
it makes us even bigger assholes than we already are.

522
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,520
所以你们什么都没查到
So you got nothing.

523
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,150
没有
Nothing.

524
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,950
他要么不知道  要么不肯说
Either he didn't know or he wouldn't say.

525
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:48,700
他不知道
He didn't know.

526
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,510
这下我们永远都不会知道了
I guess we'll never know now.

527
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,040
真有必要杀他吗
Did you really have to kill him?

528
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,320
他不知道
He didn't know.

529
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,130
好吧
Okay.

530
00:45:57,450 --> 00:45:58,890
下一步怎么办
What's our next play?

531
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,290
没有下一步了
We don't have one.

532
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,160
结束了
It's over.

533
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,590
不
No.

534
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,710
不能就这么放弃
We don't just give up.

535
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,030
我们别无选择
We have no choice.

536
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,120
那又怎样
So what?

537
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,760
-你不干了  -我们什么都没查到
- You're done? - We got nothing.

538
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,720
-那就去找啊  -什么都没有
- So we find something. - We've got nothing.

539
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,530
我不能就这么当他死了
I can't just leave him for dead.

540
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,920
你以为我愿意吗
Do you think I want to?!

541
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,690
你以为我什么都不想做吗
Don't you think I'd do anything?

542
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,040
道尔顿说得对
Dalton was right.

543
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,840
他说得对
He was right.

544
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,830
他把贾伯交出去的那一刻  贾伯就死了
Job was dead from the moment he handed him over.

545
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:03,700
你他妈去哪儿
Where the hell are you going?

546
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,140
他死了
He's dead.

547
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,050
有人在家吗
Anybody home?

548
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,060
有人吗
Hello?

549
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,650
爸爸
Daddy!

550
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,220
你好啊  小伙子
What's up, little man?

551
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,080
-你妈妈呢  -在楼上
- Where's your mommy? - Upstairs.

552
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,510
宝贝  我回来了
Yeah? Babe, I'm home.

553
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,320
来了
Coming.

554
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,080
天呐  你长大了
God, you got bigger.

555
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,390
现在多重  900多斤吗
What do you weigh, like 1,000 pounds?

556
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,260
-没有啦  -那有3米高了吧
- No. - What, are you, like 10 feet tall?

557
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,930
-没有  -好吧  也许明天就有了
- No. - Okay, maybe tomorrow.

558
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,740
你回来早了
You're home early.

559
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,180
对  我们今天把三季刊弄完了
Yeah, we finished the triquarterlies today.

560
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,940
那个亚洲佬给我们放假了
The slope gave everybody the day off.

561
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,030
真好
Nice.

562
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,930
锅里好香啊
It smells really good in here.

563
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,030
是炖肉和汤
It's just a pot roast and some soup.

564
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,420
-想不去想打篮球  -想
- You want to go shoot some hoops? - Yeah.

565
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,230
想啊  那我们去玩
Yeah? Maybe we'll go play

566
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,050
让妈妈做好晚饭叫我们好不好
and Mommy will let us know when dinner's ready.

567
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,160
别跟上次一样  又把我打败了  好不好
Don't beat me like you did last time, though, okay?

568
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,430
-对你老爹我放点水呗  -我会的
- Will you take it easy on your old man? - I will.

569
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,340
我肯定会打败你的
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna beat you, though.

570
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,020
我爱你
I love you.

571
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,330
如果是你  你会从哪着手
Where would you start?

572
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,050
山麓
The foothills.

573
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,570
博迪克家
The Boedickers.

574
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,040
我听说他们家被烧光了
I heard they got burned down.

575
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,830
亚伦·博迪克还活着
Aaron Boedicker is still alive.

576
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,860
你好啊  博迪克
Hey, Boedicker.

577
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,140
还记得我吗
Remember me?

578
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,020
四天前你在哪
Where were you four nights ago?

579
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,710
去你妈的
Fuck you.

580
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,440
我不会问你第二遍
I'm not gonna ask you again.

581
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,310
我不知道你他妈想干什么
I don't know what the fuck you want,

582
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,030
但我屁都不会告诉你
but I'm not telling you shit.

583
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,740
我的手被你废了
You took my fucking hand.

584
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,910
丽贝卡·鲍曼在四天前被杀
Rebecca Bowman got killed four days ago.

585
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,330
那婊子自找的
Fucking bitch had it coming.

586
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:07,940
你看  你一说这种话
Yeah, see, when you say things like that,

587
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,740
就说明跟你有关系
that makes me think you had something to do with it.

588
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,920
想怎么折磨就来吧
You can torture me all you want,

589
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,600
你这个该死的虐待狂
you fucking sadist,

590
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,020
但我只会告诉你两件事
but I'm only gonna tell you two things.

591
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:22,260
我没有杀她
I didn't kill her

592
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,870
她死了我根本不在乎
and I don't give a shit she's dead.

593
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:32,430
没错  你确实知道些什么
Yeah, you do know something.

594
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:36,550
我知道的多了
Oh, I know a lot of things.

595
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:39,020
知道没有双手的人怎么擦屁股吗
You know how a guy with no hands wipes his ass?

596
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,210
我有个侄子
I've-- I've got a nephew.

597
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,860
艾尔杰
Eljay.

598
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,710
觉得自己是个摇滚明星
Thinks he's some kind of rock star.

599
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,390
他搞过那女的一段时间
He was fucking her for a while.

600
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,480
我去哪找他
Where do I find him?

601
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:04,170
我不知道他住哪
I don't know where he stays,

602
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,580
但他在一个叫蛇眼的鬼地方演夜场
but he plays nights at this shithole called Snake Eyes.

603
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,870
就在桥附近
It's off the connector.

604
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,590
如果我发现你撒谎
I find out you're lying to me,

605
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,080
我会回来废掉另一只手
I come back for the other hand.

606
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:36,650
这里不欢迎你
You're not welcome around here.

607
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,800
那我最好赶紧走吧
I better get going, then.

608
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,540
-你走不出去了  -赌什么的
- You're not going anywhere. - Want to bet?

609
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:52,110
看来你要被打成马蜂窝了
Looks like you're gonna end up full of holes.

610
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,320
那也是在我给你开个洞之后的事了
Not before I put one big fucking hole in you.

611
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,420
-行了  都住手  -该死
- Okay, let's break it up. -  God damn it.

612
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,480
马上
Now.

613
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,480
大多数警察都清楚  这山里不是好来的
Most cops know better than to come into the hills.

614
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,660
大多数混球都清楚  跟我顶嘴没好下场
Most assholes know better than to talk back to me.

615
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,800
这让我想起来  如果仔细找找
Something makes me think if I start looking,

616
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,130
可能会找到很多逮捕令上的人站在这呢
I'm gonna find a lot of outstanding warrants standing here.

617
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,810
你跟踪我来的
So you are following me around.

618
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,470
对  这还用问吗  顺便提一下
Yeah, I thought that was obvious by the way I pulled up

619
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:31,360
千钧一发的时候  是我救了你的小命
right at the nick of time to save your ass.

620
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,550
你来这里干什么  胡德
What are you doing here, Hood?

621
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,920
拜访一个老朋友
Just visiting an old friend.

622
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,910
我猜你有头绪了
I'm guessing you're working an angle.

623
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,150
丽贝卡是被她舅舅的某个对头杀死的
That Rebecca was killed by one of her uncle's enemies.

624
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,770
我什么头绪都没有
I'm not working any angles.

625
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,420
现在你是警长  烂摊子归你收拾
You're the sheriff now. This is your fucking mess.

626
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,180
对  而你仍然是这烂摊子里的疑犯
Yeah, and you're still a person of interest in this mess.

627
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,950
难道你要跟踪我一整天
Does that mean you're gonna follow me all fucking day?

628
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:56,330
胡德  你爱信不信
Yeah, well, believe it or not, Hood,

629
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,060
有那时间  我干点别的好不好
I've got better things to do with my time.

630
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,060
好
Good.

631
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,430
顺便说一句  不用谢
And you're welcome, by the way.

632
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,130
四天前
