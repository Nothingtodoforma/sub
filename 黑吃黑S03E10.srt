1
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,650
有人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hello?

2
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,620
有人吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hello?

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,550
放老子出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me the fuck out!

4
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,000
你他妈是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the fuck are you?

5
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,120
没想到你这么矮小
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're smaller than I thought you'd be,

6
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,750
我觉得很奇怪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}which is strange because you

7
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,880
你居然能把训练教官胖揍一顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}did a hell of a number on your drill instructor

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,340
他可不是吃素的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and he's not a pussy.

9
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,920
这应该不是你第一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Probably not the first

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,730
因为暴脾气而惹上麻烦吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}time your temper got you into trouble, is it?

11
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,030
可能你就是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's probably why you

12
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,600
因此才参军的  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}joined the army in the first place, right?

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,390
还是说你参军是因为爱国
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or are you just a patriot?

14
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,500
这是什么地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where am I?

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,780
你该问这不是什么地方
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where aren't you?

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,170
这里不是本宁堡的禁闭室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You aren't in the brig at Fort Benning

17
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,120
也不会有军事法庭判你在军事监狱蹲两年
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}facing a court-martial that could have landed you two years

18
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,850
然后把你变成比现在还混蛋的混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in military prison and turned you into an even meaner asshole than you are now.

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,310
我把你转出来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I had you moved.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,030
不用谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're welcome.

21
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,480
那到底是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So what is this?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,740
应该是数学课吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I guess it's math class,

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,750
我没穿军装没戴徽章
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}because I'm not wearing a rank or an insignia

24
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,090
这里也不是监狱  那么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and this isn't a cell, so

25
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,350
特种部队吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Special Ops?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,220
去死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, fuck you!

27
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,330
我去死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck me?

28
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,580
过几天见  小子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll see you in a couple days, kid.

29
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,750
什么  你去哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? Where are you going?

30
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,090
等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey!

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,110
混蛋  给我回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, asshole, come back!

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,190
回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey!

33
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,820
放老子出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me the fuck outta here!

34
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,730
{\fn方正黑体简体}《黑吃黑》第三季 第十集[本季终]
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Banshee S03E10

35
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,980
见到你很荣幸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's an honor to meet you.

36
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,400
我说了  我是你的铁杆粉丝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Like I said, I'm a huge fan.

37
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,920
贱人  我不知道你把我当成谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bitch, I don't know who you think I am...

38
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,030
你是贾伯  传说中的贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're Job. The Job.

39
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,030
91年你黑进加拉加斯国家银行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In '91, you hacked Banco Nacional of Caracas

40
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,820
转移了七百万美金
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and transferred $7 million

41
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,280
给南美的人道主义非营利组织
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to humanitarian nonprofits across South America.

42
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,220
半年后  你又用僵尸病毒感染了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Six months later, you infected the mainframe of Wing-Lijun Shipping

43
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,340
文氏船运公司的系统  造成近一亿美元损失
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with a botnet virus that cost them almost 100 million--

44
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,920
我知道你在用英语叨逼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know the words coming out your face are technically English,

45
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,200
但我不知道你叨逼的是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I still don't know what the fuck you talking about.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,920
我在网络犯罪部花了七年时间追踪你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I spent seven years at cybercrimes tracking you,

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,260
研究你的作案手法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}studying your work.

48
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,840
你黑进军械库这次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The hack into the armory,

49
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,600
与其他案子相比  真是小菜一碟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that was simple compared with your other efforts.

50
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,700
但是你关掉我们电网的定时逆变手法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the way you pulled off the timed reverse on our power grid--

51
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,800
世界上可能只有两三个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I mean, there are maybe two or three other hackers

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,050
有那个本事  但他们都在中国
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who could have pulled that off and they live in China.

53
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,120
那你为什么不去中国
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Then why don't you fuck off over there

54
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,100
把他们叨逼死呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and bore them to death?

55
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,550
1994年你渗透进国安局数据库
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}In '94, you infiltrated the NSA database

56
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,020
删除了40项
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and deleted the personnel

57
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,180
秘密军事行动的人事记录
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}records of 40 covert military operatives.

58
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,570
我猜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My theory--

59
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,540
其实你只需要让一个人销声匿迹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you just needed to disappear one guy.

60
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,300
但是你做事谨慎小心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you were just being thorough,

61
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,260
一如既往
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}as always.

62
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,140
就是这件事让中情局彻底盯上了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that one put you on the CIA's radar for good.

63
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,860
我再跟你说一遍
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would tell you again

64
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,080
你认错人了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you have mistaken me for someone else

65
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,660
但是你好像很兴奋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but you seem so goddamn excited,

66
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,700
我不想扫了你的兴  利奥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I hate to ruin your fun, Leo.

67
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,900
你就是传说中的金奖券  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're the golden ticket, Job.

68
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,480
我一定会从你身上捞到好处
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I am going to cash you in.

69
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,900
我很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry.

70
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,440
你鲁莽  不计后果
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're impetuous, reckless.

71
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,300
-你违背了我  -我以为那是在帮你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You defied me. - I thought I was helping you.

72
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,900
谢谢你  博登
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you, Burton.

73
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,460
去把车开过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bring the car around.

74
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,260
早在你出生之前
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've been dealing with men

75
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,040
我就跟弗拉奇尔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}like Frazier and Morales

76
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,020
莫拉莱斯这样的人打交道了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}since before you were born.

77
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,580
你要慢慢学  瑞贝卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'll learn, Rebecca.

78
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,160
但学之前  得先明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But in order to learn, you have to accept the fact

79
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,880
你并不是无所不知
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that you don't know anything.

80
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,860
至少现在不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not yet.

81
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,700
我明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I understand.

82
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,400
话说回来  我们都会犯错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Having said that, we've both made mistakes,

83
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,270
但是这些错误不能再犯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}mistakes that can never happen again.

84
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,700
你要去费城吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you going to Philadelphia?

85
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,180
我们都要去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We all are.

86
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,250
你他妈放开我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Man, get the fuck off of me.

87
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,920
够了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, that's enough!

88
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,980
别想碰她  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't even think about it, asshole.

89
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,700
见鬼  你还好吗  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shit, are you okay, Job?

90
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,510
你他妈问的这是什么蠢问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck kind of stupid-ass question is that?

91
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,020
他没事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's okay.

92
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,520
你知道斯托是怎么找上我们的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got any idea how Stowe landed on us?

93
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,300
我们大意了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got sloppy.

94
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,980
但他还没查明一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, he doesn't know everything,

95
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,750
所以我们才有命等救援
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and that's the only thing keeping us alive until help arrives.

96
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,690
是吗  那他该找谁帮忙呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah? And who's gonna help him, hmm?

97
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,360
他只有三个朋友  全在这了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That man has exactly three friends and they all right here.

98
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,640
有点信心好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Have some faith, huh?

99
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,090
我就这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Have you met me?

100
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,480
他会来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's gonna come.

101
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,400
我知道他会来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, I know he'll come.

102
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,860
他会他妈的带着整队人来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He'll take on the whole motherfucking platoon.

103
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,590
没准还能通过大门
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Might even make it past the front gate.

104
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,100
就算那样  他和我们之间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But there's still a shitload of mercs

105
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,180
还隔着一堆武装雇佣兵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with a shitload of guns between him and us.

106
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,780
我要见斯托上校
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need to see Colonel Stowe.

107
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,600
我们是老相识了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're old friends.

108
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,900
除非你他妈给我开门  否则我不会走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not leaving till you open that fucking gate.

109
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,000
他会有办法的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He'll find a way.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,580
去你妈的  有屁办法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck you, he'll find a way.

111
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,840
他可不是你的神仙教母
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He ain't your fairy godmother

112
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,070
能实现你的所有梦想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}come to make all your dreams come true.

113
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,030
你还要让他为你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How many more times

114
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,840
出生入死多少次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}does he have to put his ass on the line for you

115
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,310
总有一天  他脑袋要他妈开花了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}until he gets his motherfucking head blown off?

116
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,350
你是在怪我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're blaming me for this?

117
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,010
是谁他妈把目标操了个爽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I ain't the one who fucked the mark!

118
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,150
-去你妈的  贾伯  -不  去你妈的  卡莉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Oh, fuck you, Job. - No, fuck you, Carrie.

119
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,940
或是安娜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or Ana.

120
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,560
谁他妈知道你现在叫啥名字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or whatever the fuck you calling yourself today.

121
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,440
既然你这么担心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you were so worried...

122
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,400
你那男朋友怎么可能知道...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How'd your boyfriend know exactly...

123
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,660
你完全可以叫停这次的任务
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}...you could have shut this job down.

124
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,670
-我很专业  -你他妈泄露了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I'm a professional. - What the fuck did you let slip?

125
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,260
你说你到底告诉那个混蛋什么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You tell me what you told that motherfucker!

126
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,030
你居然敢这么说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How dare you?

127
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,930
你俩都他妈给我闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Both of you shut the fuck up!

128
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,160
如果我们得死  那就死吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If we're gonna die, then we're gonna die.

129
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,290
但也起码有点尊严好吗  操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Have some motherfucking dignity for fuck's sake.

130
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,000
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job...

131
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,930
她要是泄露了什么  我们四个早就死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}if she slipped up, the four of us would be dead already.

132
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,130
我们要活着出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We gonna make it out of here alive,

133
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,650
就必须要团结
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}we got to stick together.

134
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,490
好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah?

135
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,840
请进
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come.

136
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,140
-你来这里干什么  -刚好路过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What are you doing here? - I was in the neighborhood.

137
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,330
我没时间和你玩游戏
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't have time for games.

138
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,040
你要是有事找我  就快点说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you have business with me, get to it.

139
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,510
怎么了  上校  出什么事了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's going on, Colonel? Everything okay?

140
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,700
听着  警长  我只能认为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, Sheriff, I can only imagine

141
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,770
你的生活很无聊  很卑微
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}how boring and insignificant your life must be,

142
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,400
但说实话  我根本不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but honestly, I don't give two shits.

143
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,850
如果你没什么屁事的话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you don't have a reason to be here,

144
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,920
就他妈滚出我的基地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}then get the fuck off my base.

145
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,010
我有六百万的理由
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got six million reasons.

146
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,850
原来警长是贼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The sheriff is a thief.

147
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
我其实不是警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not really a sheriff.

148
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,560
你是来这里谈判的吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've come here to negotiate?

149
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,320
我是来告诉你  如果你不放了我的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I came here to tell you that if you don't let my friends go,

150
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,060
就再也见不到你的钱了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you'll never see your money again.

151
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,350
我可以把你关在这
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can keep you here,

152
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,950
一个个的砍掉你的手指
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}remove your fingers one by one

153
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,610
直到你告诉我那些钱的下落
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}until you tell me where the cash is.

154
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,440
你我都清楚  来这儿之前我做好了准备
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We both know I wouldn't have come here without insurance.

155
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,770
现在  我也不知道你的钱在哪儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right now I have no clue where your money is.

156
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,260
如果我半小时没回去的话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And if I'm not back in half an hour,

157
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,780
会有人打电话给刑事调查局
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}my insurance is gonna call CID.

158
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,850
你曾经当过兵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've been a soldier.

159
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,280
我猜你曾经浪费了你所有的机会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My guess is you wasted every opportunity you ever had,

160
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,560
辜负了所有对你有期待的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}disappointed everyone who ever took a chance on you.

161
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,130
这是你这种不服从命令的混蛋最擅长的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's what insubordinate assholes like you do best.

162
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,560
你背叛了自己的潜力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You betray your own potential.

163
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,650
你还挺会说教
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wow, you're really good at this.

164
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,690
我他妈的要我的钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want my fucking money!

165
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,280
我要保证能活着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want proof of life.

166
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,150
渴吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thirsty?

167
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,540
你脱水了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're dehydrated.

168
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,390
你的器官要开始停止工作了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your organs are starting to shut down.

169
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,970
我肯定你能感觉到  头疼  发冷
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sure you can feel it. The headaches, the chills.

170
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,810
很快幻觉会变得很强烈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Soon the hallucinations will become so intense,

171
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,710
你会失去现实的感觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you'll lose all sense of reality.

172
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,710
和我说实话  我给你回报
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tell me the truth. I will reward you.

173
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,020
你母亲的名字是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What was your mother's name?

174
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,970
凯瑟琳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Catherine.

175
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,820
凯瑟琳  是个好母亲吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Catherine. Was she a good mother?

176
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,440
我想是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I guess so.

177
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,590
你要更确定一点儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna need you to be more definitive with me.

178
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,700
她是个好母亲吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Was she a good mother?

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your father's name was Dennis.

183
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,010
丹尼斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dennis.

184
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,870
-你也爱他吗  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Did you love him, too? - Yes.

185
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,360
你父亲经常暴打你的母亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your father regularly beat the shit out of your mother.

186
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,320
让她进了六次医院
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put her in the hospital six times.

187
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,750
他也打你  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He beat you, too, didn't he?

188
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,190
-不是  -他当然打了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- No. - Of course he did.

189
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,090
-没有  -他就是打了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- No. - Of course he did.

190
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,680
所以你杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why you had to kill him.

191
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,170
我没有杀他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I didn't kill him.

192
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,430
你当然杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Of course you killed him.

193
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,300

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He was a horrible man who made you suffer.

194

他让你和你母亲痛苦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He made you and your mother suffer.

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,410
暂时活着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}For the moment.

212
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,610
去把我的钱拿回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go get my fucking money.

213
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,330
我要关照你一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna pay a little visit.

214
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,820
我们还没好好打过招呼呢  酒保
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We haven't really gotten acquainted, bartender.

215
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,170
你好  柯特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hello, Kurt.

216
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,920
-加尔文  -好久不见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Calvin. - It's been a long time.

217
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,020
欢迎回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Welcome home.

218
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,040
还不错吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not bad, huh?

219
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,770
是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

220
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,620
你离开的那晚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, when you disappeared that night,

221
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,350
我以为你只是需要点时间冷静一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought you just needed to clear your head for a minute.

222
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,160
但没想到这么久
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But this is a lot to take in.

223
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,010
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sure.

224
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,750
现在你又回来  和离开时一样突然
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now you're back just as suddenly as you left, huh?

225
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,010
是时候回家了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was time to come home.

226
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,530
对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Right.

227
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,210
你残忍地离我们而去  柯特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You left us in the lurch that night, Kurt.

228
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,800
有人追杀你  找你报仇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There were some who wanted to hunt you down, make you pay.

229
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,180
是我护着你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I defended you.

230
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,610
为了你我骗了兄弟会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I lied to the Brotherhood for you.

231
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,380
但你又突然回来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And now you come back here unannounced

232
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,220
还对贾斯帕和布莱斯大打出手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you do what you did to Jasper and Bryce.

233
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,930
现在我也很难保你周全了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're making it very hard for me to keep you safe.

234
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,850
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Am I?

235
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,560
不过...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Still...

236
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,930
血浓于水
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you're my blood.

237
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,260
你总是说  再亲亲不过亲兄弟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And like you always said, brothers before Brotherhood, right?

238
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,940
所以  哥  我给你一个机会改正
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, big brother, I'm gonna give you a chance to do the right thing.

239
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,940
你脱掉这身警服
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You take off this uniform

240
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,220
回到你真正的家族中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you come back to your real family.

241
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,890
我会摆平一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll smooth things over.

242
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,510
就像过去你保护我那样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll get you in the way you got me in back in the day.

243
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,910
我要做对的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am going to do the right thing.

244
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,270
我要把兄弟会关了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna shut down the Brotherhood.

245
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,390
所有的一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All of it.

246
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,060
加尔文  你好好想想
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You be smart, Calvin.

247
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:03,280
你有妻子  还有儿子需要抚养
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have a wife and a little boy to raise.

248
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,720
别插手了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Walk away.

249
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,210
别插手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Walk away?

250
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,940
你把我从爸那儿救走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not the dumb little shit I was

251
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,400
第一次带我去兄弟会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when you saved me from Dad,

252
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,680
我再也不像以前那么无知了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}took me to my first rally.

253
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,820
我不可能不参与的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There is no walking away from it.

254
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,040
我与兄弟会共存
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am the Brotherhood.

255
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,370
照顾好你的家庭
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Take care of your family.

256
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,150
不要跑到我家来让我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't you come in here and tell me

257
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,420
照顾好我的家庭  你这个叛徒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to take care of my family, you fucking traitor.

258
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,190
我们会弄死你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We will fucking bury you.

259
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,750
听到没
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You hear me?

260
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,400
要小心哦  哥
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Better watch your back, big brother.

261
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,920
今天不太顺吧  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Tough day, Kai?

262
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,380
看样子家庭重聚了啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So, I see there's been a family reunion.

263
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,650
那么  凯  我他妈的到底要跟谁做生意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, tell me, Kai, who the fuck am I in business with?

264
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,770
你  还是她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You or her?

265
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,090
是跟我们做生意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're in business with us.

266
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,330
这么说是没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you say.

267
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,870
不过一个人同意  一个人不同意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But one says yes, the other says no.

268
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,120
我现在都断货了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And now I have no product at all.

269
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,430
我们就是来讨论这个事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're here to change all of that.

270
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,500
你没带货来啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You didn't pull up in a truck.

271
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,340
收下这个礼物和我们的提议
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Accept this gift and our proposal,

272
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,770
明天我们免费给你一车货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}there'll be a truck tomorrow free of charge.

273
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,740
明朝的剑果然好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ming made a great fucking sword.

274
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,040
不过锋不锋利  还是要带到战场上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But you can never tell the real quality of a blade

275
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,840
试试看才知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}until it's used in battle.

276
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,060
你的提议是什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's the proposal?

277
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,150
慢点  慢点  别噎着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Slowly, slowly, slowly. Take your time.

278
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,100
别着急  慢慢吃  慢慢吃
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's okay. Take your time. Take your time.

279
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,490
你心里一直憋着一股怒气
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've been angry for such a long time.

280
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,750
能让你不去害怕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That anger is there to protect you from fear.

281
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,790
可以说那种害怕
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, we could argue that the fear

282
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,470
来自一个暴力酗酒的父亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}comes from an abusive and drunk father,

283
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,060
但它从哪产生其实不重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but it doesn't really matter where it comes from.

284
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,830
重要的是  它能被打败
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What matters is that it can be beaten.

285
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,840
我会让你摆脱这个包袱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna rid you of that burden

286
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,910
帮你达到你的潜力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so you can reach your potential.

287
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,420
那时你就准备好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then you're gonna be ready.

288
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,010
准备好做什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ready for what?

289
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,160
再当兵吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The army again?

290
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,700
不
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

291
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,660
不是当兵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not the army.

292
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,890
别的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Something different.

293
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,290
嘿  邦克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Bunk.

294
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,010
奥特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Otto.

295
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,880
贾斯帕和布莱斯向你问好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jasper and Bryce send their best.

296
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,430
谢了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks.

297
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,730
你是要像个娘炮一样站那儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So you gonna stand there all day like a pussy?

298
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,750
-还是打算过来玩玩  -嘿  走开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Or you gonna come over here and play? - Hey, clear out.

299
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,870
立刻
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now.

300
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,070
我不会说第二次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not gonna tell you again.

301
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,720
走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go.

302
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,790
-咱们还会再见  邦克  -放开他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- We'll be seeing you, Bunk. - Get off him!

303
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,310
我知道你还会见我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know you're gonna be seeing me

304
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,820
因为老子要去找你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'cause I'm gonna be coming for you.

305
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,120
咱们都知道你没有支援就是个娘炮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And we both know what a fucking pussy you are without your backup.

306
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,170
-放开他  -操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Get off him! - Fucker!

307
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,440
-邦克  放开他  -我靠
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Bunker, let him go. - Come on!

308
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,360
妈的  没用
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shit. It's not working.

309
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,700
听着  继续试试
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now look, keep going.

310
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,770
-别放弃  -但请闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Don't give up. - But please do shut up.

311
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,050
你他妈搞的我没法集中注意力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're breaking my motherfucking concentration.

312
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,790
走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go!

313
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,150
墨菲  离开这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Murphy! Get out there!

314
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,200
你去把那女的带到我这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You get the girl, bring her to me.

315
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,360
快去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go!

316

317
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,820
咱们得快点了  老头
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got to hurry the fuck up, old man.

318
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,100
听着  打断大拇指
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, just break the thumb.

319
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,880
糖果  你确定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sugar, are you sure?

320
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,730
这是唯一的办法能让他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's the only way he can get--

321
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,190
这真是把好剑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is a good fucking sword!

322
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,840
我们得送你上车
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We need to get you in the car.

323
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,160
没人能把我从我的地盘赶出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one's chasing me out of my place of business.

324
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,420
-我们被困在里面了  -那我们就杀出去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- We'll be trapped inside. - Then we'll fight our way out.

325
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,750
老大  我恳请您再考虑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sir, I respectfully urge you to recons--

326
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,670
这是我的办公室
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is my office.

327
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,550
所有人出去  快点  动起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everybody out. Come on. Move!

328
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,230
你听到了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You hear that, man?

329
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,120
从这里传出来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Coming from over here.

330
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,270
快点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, man.

331
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,070
好了  贱人  咱们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, bitch. Let's go.

332
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,510
你好啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, hello there.

333
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,030
-他们去哪儿了  -我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Where the hell are they? - Pssh, I don't know.

334
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,840
咋了  赶紧离开这儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? Let's get the fuck out of here.

335
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,010
快啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on.

336
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:18,890
小心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold it!

337
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,340
我去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God!

338
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,680
我绕着走吸引火力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna circle around and draw his fire.

339
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,930
-准备  -走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Ready? - Go!

340
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,080
-糖果  -安全
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Sugar! - I'm clear.

341
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,590
手榴弹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Grenade!

342
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,890
嘿  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, baby.

343
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,570
还记得我吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Remember me?

344
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,740
谁能忘了这么一张丑脸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who could forget a face that fucking ugly?

345
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,940
不赖啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not bad.

346
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,450
你一直藏在我眼皮底下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've been holding out on me.

347
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,900
你打架比做爱在行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You fight better than you fuck.

348
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,340
瞄准你了  混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got you, you motherfucker.

349
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,740
太他妈恶心了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, fucking messy.

350
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,420
你不喜欢我杀人的方式
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You don't like the way I kill,

351
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,860
那下一个你来杀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you kill the next one.

352
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,060
搞定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Done.

353
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,080
没人喜欢爱装逼的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No one likes a wiseass.

354
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,800
操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck.

355
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,540
雷诺克斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lennox!

356
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,340
雷诺克斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lennox!

357
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:31,010
雷诺克斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lennox.

358
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,540
我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I--

359
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,830
你好  弗拉奇尔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hello, Frazier.

360
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,210
-普罗科特  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Proctor. - That's right.

361
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,900
我说过你惹错了人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I told you you were making a mistake.

362
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,020
你想到新交易了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is there a new deal you have in mind?

363
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,660
对  但不是和你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, but not with you.

364
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,060
我知道你现在看不到周围景象
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, I know you can't see the room right now,

365
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,590
所以我尽力帮你描述一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}so I'll do my best to describe it for you.

366
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,650
地板上有三个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got three men on the floor.

367
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,850
全死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're all dead.

368
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,960
你兄弟雷诺克斯  躺在你脚边
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Your buddy Lennox, he's at your feet

369
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,520
血流不止  垂死挣扎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}slowly bleeding to death.

370
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,010
表情十分痛苦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He appears distraught.

371
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,140
我跟我侄女丽贝卡以及博登在这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm here with my niece Rebecca and Burton.

372
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,380
你认识博登的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know Burton.

373
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,030
还有我们的好伙伴赫克托·莫拉莱斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And our mutual associate Hector Morales.

374
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,590
赫克托刚拿到一把新剑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, Hector, he has a beautiful new sword.

375
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,190
是我专门送他的礼物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It was a gift I got him for this very occasion.

376
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,160
你也闻到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And, as you can smell,

377
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,520
我在抽你最高级的雪茄
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm smoking one of your most excellent cigars.

378
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,370
你跟魔鬼做了交易
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You made a deal with the devil,

379
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,290
傻逼德国佬
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you stupid Dutchie.

380
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,590
别这么叫我  我不喜欢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't call me that. I don't like that.

381
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,270
你会付出代价的  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're gonna pay for this, Kai.

382
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,110
谁都一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We all pay eventually.

383
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,520
不过我付出代价的时候  你没机会看到了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But in my case, you won't be around to see it.

384
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,960
是没机会听到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Or rather hear about it.

385
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,790
你好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey there.

386
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,760
你个蠢货
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You stupid cerote.

387
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,830
你难道不知道他会像玩我一样玩你吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't you know he's gonna fuck you like he fucked me?

388
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,820
不  是你玩死了自己  瞎子
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, you fucked yourself, blind man.

389
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,740
其实  我一直没机会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, I never did get to thank you

390
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,300
当面谢谢你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}in person for the...

391
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,220
给我的那份小礼物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}little gift you gave me.

392
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,510
每次摸那道疤都会想到你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think of you every time I feel it.

393
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,960
动手吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just do it.

394
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,890
真够尴尬的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, that's just embarrassing.

395
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,850
我从不失手
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I never miss.

396
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,170
抱歉花了这么长时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry I took so long.

397
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,930
我从来没怀疑过你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I never doubted you for a minute.

398
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,890
你不是说他会为了救我们而死吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought you said he'd get killed trying to save us.

399
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,660
但我一直相信他会来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, but I never doubted he'd come.

400
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,830
凯莉在那里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's Carrie?

401
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,750
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

402
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:21,230
放下枪  不然我就崩了她
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Put the gun down or I'll blow her head off.

403
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,070
-不要  -快点  我说到做到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- No. - Do it. I will kill her.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Let her go. - Put the fucking gun down, Hood!

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Let her go now. - Don't play me! I will kill her!

407
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:44,580
-你不会的  -你他妈把枪放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- No, you're not. - Put the fucking gun down!

408
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,160
戈登

糖果  帮帮我

417
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,700
-坚持住  -我撑不过去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hold on. - I'm not gonna make it.

418
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,990
别这样说  你会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't talk like that. You're gonna be fine.

419
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,160
-我们能把你救出去  -宝贝  我撑不住了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- We're gonna get you out of here. - Baby, I'm not gonna make it.

420
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,790
家里不是只有你一个人会用枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're not the only gunslinger in the family.

421
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,370
你为什么要这么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why did you do this?

422
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,690
我是来带你回家的  卡莉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I came to take you home, Carrie.

423
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,640
我对你的爱从没停过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I never stopped loving you.

424
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,930
你知道的  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know that, right?

425
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,060
我爱你  撑住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I love you. Stay with me.

426
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,570
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job.

427
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,530
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's okay.

428
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,790

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's okay.

429

你要好好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You be good, okay?

430
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,080
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}凯迪店

431
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,710
你准备告诉我今天到底怎么回事吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You want to tell me what the hell happened out there today?

432
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,990
我回来了  很多人很不满
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}A lot of those guys are angry that I'm back.

433
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,500
他们觉得被背叛了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They feel betrayed.

434
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,090
我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah. Yeah, I got that.

435
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,050
不  我说的是你抓了一个平民
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, I meant the part where you grabbed a civilian

436
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,030
在整个餐厅的人面前想掐死他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and started strangling him in front of a diner full of witnesses.

437
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,200
-对不起  -对不起  去他妈的对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Sorry about that. - You're sorry? Fuck sorry, okay?

438
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,570
我也不喜欢那种人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't like those guys any more than you do,

439
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,850
-但你要是不喜欢警徽  -我就是那种人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- but if you're gonna wear that badge-- - I am guys like that!

440
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,210
他有过的那种肮脏龌龊的想法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Every evil, twisted thought that he has had,

441
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,840
我也有过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have had.

442
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,590
他做的每件操蛋事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Every fucked-up thing that he's done,

443
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,970
我都做过
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have done.

444
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,200
我做过好多恶心的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've done things that would make you sick.

445
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,570
他们让我恶心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They make me sick.

446
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,450
你觉得这地方只有你一个人有污点吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You think you're the only one around here that's got dirt on him?

447
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,650
我也做过  一些事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've done some... things.

448
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,480
邦克  我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, Bunker, I--

449
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:19,310
我不了解你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know you, okay?

450
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,430
但在我看来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But from what I've seen,

451
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,590
你已经不是原来那样了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you're not the man you used to be.

452
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,340
我会一直是那样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will always be that man.

453
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,210
穿上这身制服也无法洗净我的罪孽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Putting on this uniform does not wipe my slate clean.

454
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,010
我在尽我所能地做出些改变
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm doing everything I can to change.

455
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,180
每过一段时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And every once in a while...

456
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,750
我都要告诉自己
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I manage to convince myself

457
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,540
我已经变得更好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that I'm a better person.

458
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,290
但我一接触到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the minute that I come into contact

459
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,260
那帮混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}with one of those fucking guys

460
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,900
看到他们看我的那种眼神
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and see the way that they look at me,

461
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,930
我内心就充满了恨意
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all I feel is hate

462
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,560
和愤怒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and anger

463
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,600
我根本摆脱不掉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I can't shake it.

464
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,150
好的  听我说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, all right. Listen to me.

465
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,160
等等  看着我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen, listen. Hold it. Look at me.

466
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,140
你所感受到的并不是愤怒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, that isn't anger that you're feeling.

467
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,600
而是羞耻和负罪感
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's the shame and the guilt.

468
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,860
相信我  我们都有这种感觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And trust me, we all feel that.

469
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,990
大家都有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All of us.

470
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,390
所以我们才比他们好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And that is what makes you better than them.

471
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,580
如果你感受不到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you didn't feel that,

472
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:43,540
我才会开始担心你  知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that's when I'd start to worry, all right?

473
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,780
懂了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You hear me?

474
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:47,570
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

475
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,530
现在  你能向我保证
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, look, can you promise me

476
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,870
今天发生的事不会再发生了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that what happened out there today is never gonna happen again?

477
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,680
我不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know.

478
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,900
答得好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good answer.

479
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,830
因为要是你满口答应  那肯定是胡扯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}'Cause if you had said yes, I knew you were full of shit.

480
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,700
回家吧  好好睡一觉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go home, all right? Get some sleep.

481
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,640
谢谢  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you, sir.

482
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,900
没问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yep.

483
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,690

484
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,660
我刚从州警那逃出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just hung up with the state police.

485
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,430
上帝啊  胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus Christ, Hood.

486
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,460
戈登·霍普韦尔死了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Gordon Hopewell is dead?

487
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,550
那到底发生什么事儿了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell happened out there?

488
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:43,590
他说热那亚基地像战场一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He said Camp Genoa looks like a war zone.

489
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,680
是啊  哪天有机会我肯定告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, I'll have to tell you about it someday.

490
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,760
不  不要哪天
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, no, not someday.

491
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,120
他说刑事调查局一个小时内就能到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He said that CID is gonna be here in less than an hour.

492
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,190
我要你现在就把事情说明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We need to get your story straight.

493
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,070
他们会找你谈话的  布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're coming to talk to you, Brock.

494
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,580
你是什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you talking about?

495
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,000
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood?

496
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,160
警徽和辞职信在我桌上了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Badge and letter of resignation on my desk.

497
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,480
你开玩笑呢吗  胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you kidding? Hey! Hood!

498
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,660
你去哪儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where you going?

499
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:47,400
你不能
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You can't--

500
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,650
就这么走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you can't just leave.

501
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
这次我可不忍你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I'm not giving it back this time.

502
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,040
我对你很失望  柯特
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm disappointed in you, Kurt.

503
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,310
但路是你选的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the choice is yours to make.

504
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,680
如果你还要继续穿那身警皮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you're gonna wear that cop uniform,

505
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,870
我这儿的皮你就别要了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you can't wear mine.

506
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,710
是谁带走他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who in the hell took him?

507
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,400
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know.

508
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,990
我们怎么找他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How do we find him?

509
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,160
不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No idea.

510
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,300
通常这时候贾伯就来了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Usually that's where Job comes in.

511
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,520
你还能找谁吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Isn't there anyone you can reach out--

512
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,060
我操  我真他妈不知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God damn it, Sugar. I don't fucking know.

513
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,670
我不知道谁抓的他  不知道他在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know who took him. I don't know where he is.

514
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:53,700
我他妈也不知道怎么把他弄回来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I don't know how to fucking get him back.

515
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,440
操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck.

516
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,110
他能联系到我们之前  只能孤军奋战
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Till we hear from him, he's on his own.

517
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,000
你好像是新来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, you look like a new man.

518
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,590
就是说你在这房间里的时间
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Which means your time in this room

519
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,920
没有了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is done.

520
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,100
你是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who are you?

521
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,830
我叫道尔顿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My name is Dalton.

522
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,270
你是当兵的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Are you military?

523
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,460
曾经是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I was.

524
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,960
现在我们招募你这样的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But now I recruit men like you.

525
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,180
培养他们成为精英队
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I develop them for an elite unit.

526
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,800
什么队
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What unit?

527
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,730
哪支部队的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What branch?

528
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,600
没错
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Exactly.

529
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,650
我的方法非常不传统
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My methods are very unorthodox.

530
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,060
我只有很少的时间可以评价你的能力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have a very small window of time in which to assess your ability.

531
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:42,010
我什么方面的能力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My ability to do what?

532
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,740
把需要完成的事完成的能力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To do what needs to be done.

533
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,910
我们要是合作  应该挺愉快的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think we could do some very good work together.

534
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,550
要是我不感兴趣呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And if I'm not interested?

535
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:53,930
没事  随你走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's fine. You're free to go.

536
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,580
但你要是感兴趣  就可以子承父业了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if you do, you'll always be your father's son.

537
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:09,260
我跟他一点都不像
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm nothing like him.

538
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,570
你那帮大胡子朋友呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What happened to your friends with the beards?

539
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,040
都死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're all dead.

540
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,190
你生存能力确实很强
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You sure do have a knack for survival.

541
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,910
你见死不救  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You left me there to die, Sheriff.

542
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:08,390
我不是警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not the sheriff.

543
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,460
你想要什么  道歉吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What do you want, an apology?

544
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,020
不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

545
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,300
换我也会这么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would have done the same thing.

546
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,730
警长这活根本不适合你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, being the sheriff never really suited you.

547
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,160
是不适合
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, it didn't.

548
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,920
干我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck me.
