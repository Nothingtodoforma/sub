求你了  别打了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please, stop.

2
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,560
你他妈说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the hell did you say?

3
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,950
操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck!

4
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,360
我让你靠近点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I said come closer.

5
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,960
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What happened?

6
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,570
这贱货把我鼻子咬掉了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Cocksucker bit my nose off.

7
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,280
去吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Go.

8
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,000
你好  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hello, Kai.

9
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,620
好久不见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's been a while.

10
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,660

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-- I can't stay. I just--

15
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,420
嗯  今早调解办公室送来的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, they came from the mediator's office this morning.

16
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,900
我觉得你会想看看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just figured that you'd want to take a look at them.

17
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,740
你看了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Did you?

18
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,810
还没有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not yet, no.

19
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,590
那我们再等等吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe we should wait.

20
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,140
-什么意思  卡莉  -我不知道  我只是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What do you mean, Carrie? - I don't know, I just--

21
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,010
我知道这是我们一起做的决定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know this is what we decided.

22
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,130
可我现在不确定了  你呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not sure. Are you?

23
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,660
不  我也不确定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No. No, I'm not. I'm not sure.

24
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,230
很多事被我搞得一团糟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I made a mess of things.

25
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,930
是啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, you did.

26
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,960
但你看  我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But listen, I've--

27
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,810
我想过这些年
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've had time to think about the pressure

28
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,340
你承受的压力
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that you've been under all these years,

29
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,040
一直带着恐惧生活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the fear that you've been living with,

30
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,250
我知道你一定过得很难
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I know that must have been so hard.

31
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,990
你要是早点告诉我就好了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just wish you could have told me.

32
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,760
我知道  真的对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know. I'm so sorry.

33
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,290
我不想听你道歉
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't want you to be sorry.

34
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,030
我不想再生活在过去了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't want to spend any more time looking back.

35
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,310
我们得向前看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We've got to look forward.

36
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,070
我想重新开始  你会不会觉得我疯了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is it crazy to think that we could start over?

37
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,500
这个
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well...

38
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,340
对我们来说  疯的标准可是很高的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when it comes to crazy, I think we've set a pretty high bar.

39
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
要不这样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know what?

40
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,730
协议书我先拿着吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't I hold on to these for a bit?

41
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,200
然后  我们顺其自然吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And then, uh, we'll see how things go.

42
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,580
卡莉  该上菜了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Carrie, your order's up.

43
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,600
好  我得干活了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay. I've got to go.

44
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,250
去吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

45
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,180
你知道  要想把这破地方弄安静
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know the only way to clean this rat trap

46
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,300
只能丢上一颗炸弹  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}is with a fucking grenade, right?

47
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,290
欢迎回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Welcome home.

谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks.

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,240
南边的事搞定了吗

50
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,470
对
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah.

51
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,300
你确定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You sure?

52
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,300
那可算是解脱了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then, good riddance.

53
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,280
嗨  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, Job.

54
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,120

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, yourself.

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We okay?

56
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,430
国防部宣布热那亚营正式停用了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}DOD lists Camp Genoa as officially decommissioned.

57
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,490
没提我们的小晚会
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's no mention of our little soiree.

58
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,160
那挺好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that's great.

59
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,470
那我们和好吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So we okay?

60
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,040
你差点把我害死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You almost got me killed.

61
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,170
-我知道  -我说过你没准备好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I know. - I said you weren't ready.

62
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,260
-我求过你停止计划  -对不起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I begged you to pull the plug. - I'm sorry.

63
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,590
而现在  我一点都不在乎你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, right now, I don't give a fuck what you are.

64
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,180
你和我  有过不少交情
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We got a lot of history, you and me.

65
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,410
也许现在都应该成为
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe that's all it should be--

66
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,730
历史
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}history.

67
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,810
谁他妈派你来的  操  我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the fuck sent you? Fuck it, I already know.

68
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,180
道尔顿跟你说我什么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What did Dalton tell you about me?

69
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,640
他说你逾期了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That you're past your expiration date.

70
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,330
-你没问为什么吗  -我不在乎
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You didn't ask why? - I don't care.

71
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,930
等那个混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You will when that

72
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,010
也让人把子弹射进你脑袋里  你就在乎了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}motherfucker orders a bullet put in your brain.

73
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,660
想想吧  蠢货  最大的人民公敌不是我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Think, asshole. I ain't just public enemy number one.

74
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,950
我为你老板做了点事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I've done some shit for your boss

75
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,160
于是惹祸上身  成了隐患
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that makes me a dangerous loose end.

76
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,660
等你杀了我  你也会变成隐患
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}As soon as you kill me, you become one, too.

77
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,440
-放屁  -是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You're full of shit. - Am I?

78
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,930
你确定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You sure?

79
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,300
哥们儿  你自己去看看  自己看
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look, man. See for yourself. See for yourself.

80
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,120
看  他们来找你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Look. Look. They're coming for you.

你来杀我  他们来杀你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You came for me, but they coming for you.

82
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,980
懂吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right?

83
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,350
我不知道你为你老板干了多少活
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't know how many jobs you've done for your boss,

84
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,210
但这个  这是最后一次
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but this right here, this one's the last one.

85
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,820
懂吗  你老板把你弃掉了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay? Your boss has written you off, all right?

86
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,860
他把你弃掉了  别别  听我说  等一下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's written you off. Stop, stop. Listen to me. Wait, wait, wait.

87
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,490
他就是这种人  你知道的  不是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is what he is. You know what he is, all right?

88
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,850
听我说  我说的是实话  你知道的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen to me, I'm telling you the truth and you know it.

89
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,550
想想  想想吧兄弟
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Think. Think, man.

90
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,730
道尔顿在大清洗  我们都死定了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dalton's cleaning house. We both dead.

91

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold up, hold up. You can't leave me here.

-等着瞧吧  -我靠  听我说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Watch me. - Fuck that. Listen to me.

94
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,360
考虑长远点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You thinking about long-term survival,

95
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,250
有些重要的事  只有我能告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you need to know the things only I can tell you.

96
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,570
你知道我说的是实话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on, you know what I'm saying is true.

97
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,650
我能帮你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can help you.

98
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,730
-你叫什么  -贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What's your name? - Job.

99
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,540
好吧  贾伯  跟紧我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All right, Job, you stay close.

100
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,220
一旦落队  你就自生自灭吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You fall behind, you're on your own.

101
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,290
弗拉奇尔  这他妈什么情况
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Frazier, what the hell is this?

102
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,160
我们沟通比较少
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We don't talk much.

103
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,860
我觉得应该来报个到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I figured it was time to check in.

104
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,110
他妈的可以打电话啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You could have picked up the fucking phone.

105
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,190
没错  你也可以在决定违反
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, well, you could have, too,

106
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,420
我们的协议  让你侄女给萨尔瓦多人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}before you decided to renege on our agreement

107
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,200
卖货前  给我打个电话
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and let your niece sell to the Salvadorans.

108
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,810
你他妈说什么呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck are you talking about?

109
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,010
不好意思  你刚才说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry, what was that?

110
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,690
-没什么  -很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Nothing. - Good.

111
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,520
无凭无据的反驳不适合你  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Flimsy denials don't suit you, Kai.

112
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,430
你一向有话直说
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've always been a straight talker.

113
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,290
你让你的走狗们回避
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why don't you call off your dogs

114
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,430
咱们讨论一下需要讨论的事  怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and let us discuss what needs discussing?

115
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,910
如果我们早这么处理就好了  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It would be nice if things worked that way, wouldn't it?

116
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,100
但很可惜  我们这个行业就是如此讽刺
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But unfortunately, that is the sad irony of our business.

117
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,570
我们现在可以好好谈了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}By the time we get to talk like this,

118
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,340
但已经没什么好谈的了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}there's nothing left to discuss.

119
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,720
你肯定知道我会如何对待
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You must have known how I'd react

120
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,240
如此背叛我的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to a betrayal of this magnitude.

121
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,110
你也会这样  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Exactly like you would, yes?

122
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,220
开个价吧  弗拉奇尔  多少都给你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Just name your price, Frazier, you got it.

123
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,720
这不是多少钱的问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This isn't about money.

124
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,440
一切都是钱的问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Everything is about money.

125
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,650
这次不一样
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Not this time.

126
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,830
我从来不把赫克托·莫拉莱斯放在眼里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hector Morales has always been dirt on the bottom of my shoe.

127
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,960
但有你给他撑腰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But with you by his side,

128
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,410
那个油腔滑调的臭娘炮
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that greasy, cocksucking motherfucker

129
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,330
可能真会威胁到我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}could become a considerable threat.

130
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,760
这我可不允许
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And I can't allow that.

131
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,870
弗拉奇尔  这次你错了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Frazier, you're making a mistake.

132
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,710
我曾对你深怀期待  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I expected more from you, Kai.

133
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,010
这得怪我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shame on me.

134
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,940
就剩两件事可做了  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's only two things left for you to do, Kai.

135
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,350
给我道歉  然后去死
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And that's apologize and die.

136
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,690
老子要亲手割开
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna slit your throat

137
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,630
你这畜生的喉咙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}like a fucking cow.

138
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,340
我要听到他惨叫
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I want to hear him scream.

139
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,530
再打
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Again.

140
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,750
给我站起来  起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get your ass-- get up.

141
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,030
趴下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get down!

142
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,970
胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hood!

143
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,490
-小姐  你不能这么闯进来  -别碰我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Miss, you can't just come in here. - Don't touch me.

144
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,680
-没事的  邦克  -抱歉  警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- It's okay, Bunker. - Sorry, sir.

145
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,690
-他们把我叔叔带走了  -他们是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- They took my uncle. - They?

146
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,970
-"黑胡子"  -谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- The Black Beards. - Who?

147
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,360
费城的犯罪团伙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're a crime syndicate from Philadelphia.

148
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,550
这关我什么事呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And this is my problem because...?

149
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,080
他们要杀了我叔叔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They're going to kill him.

150
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,380
我帮不了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can't help you.

151
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,240
感谢你来找我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks for stopping by.

152
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,410
洛特斯副警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deputy Lotus.

153
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,800
该死的普罗科特  我们要怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fucking Proctor, huh? What are we gonna do about it?

154
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,530
-什么也不做  -你说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- We're not gonna do anything. - What are you talking about?

155
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,340
-我他妈才不爱管普罗科特  -我也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- I don't give a shit about Proctor. - Neither do I.

156
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,020
但那个疯侄女说我前妻艾米丽也被带走了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But the crazy niece, she told me they also took my ex-wife Emily.

157
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,020
什么  她跟普罗科特怎么扯上关系了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What? What does she have to do with Proctor?

158
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,630
她之前在照顾普罗科特的妈妈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}She took care of his mother.

159
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,450
-他老妈死了  布罗克  -我知道
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- His mother's dead, Brock. - I know.

160
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,700
他俩
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They, uh...

161
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,350
你他妈是在逗我吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You've got to be fucking kidding me.

162
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,320
可不是嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yeah, tell me about it.

163
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,670
我让邦克和瑞文去设检查站
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Alright, look, I'm gonna have Bunker and Raven set up checkpoints.

164
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,510
然后联系州警  挨家挨户...
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll call the state police. We're gonna go door-to-door--

165
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,530
用不着了  他们可能早走远了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, no, no, they're probably long gone by now.

166
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,350
也可能还没走  对吧  我们得行动起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe they're not, all right? We've gotta do something.

167
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,610
布罗克  这事别拖我下水
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Brock, I'm not gonna get involved.

168
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,210
你听我说  胡德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, listen to me, Hood!

169
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,720
我不止一次为你赴汤蹈火了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have put my ass on the line for you more than once, all right?

170
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,020
现在我求你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now I'm asking you...

171
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,070
拜托了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Please.

172
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,540
我没空
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm not here.

173
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,230
听着  我没别的选择了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen, I wouldn't ask if I had another choice,

174
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,730
拜托你帮我个忙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I need some help.

175
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,060
等下  等等  等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hold up. Hold up. Hang on. Hold up.

176
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,630
天呐  没人追  你把他们都杀了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}God. It's okay, you killed them all.

177
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,030
有几个你还补了一枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I think you killed some of them twice,

178
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,600
你杀人杀开心了吧混蛋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you trigger-happy son of a bitch.

179
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,430
还会有人来的  我们得赶快走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's gonna be more of them. We need to keep moving.

180
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,350
我喘不上气了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need a little oxygen.

181
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,400
操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck.

182
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,590
你他妈都不用喘气吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How the fuck are you not even winded?

183
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,080
我们都跑了三英里了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We just ran, like, three miles.

184
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,960
我的脚要疼死了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My feet are fucking killing me.

185
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,150
少说点话就能喘上气了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Talk less, you can breathe more.

186
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,420
听着  "牛仔铁汉"
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll tell you what, Clint Eastwood,

187
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,630
你回答问题  我就闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'll shut the fuck up when you answer me this--

188
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,380
我们这他妈是要去哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}where the fuck are we going?

189
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,120
我们得避开大路
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We need to get off the street.

190
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,580
快走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Move.

191
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,710
你没回答我问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You didn't answer my question.

192
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,770
去我那儿吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I got a place.

193
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,430
我查看了斯特林安保公司
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I reviewed the digital security logs

194
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,480
弗吉尼亚总部的安全日志
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}from Sterling Safe's headquarters in Virginia.

195
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,920
没有明显的主机违约
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No obvious mainframe breaches,

196
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,060
也没有病毒  或者外部的暴力解码
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}no embedded viruses or brute force attacks from the outside.

197
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,980
所以我转而检视内部问题
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why I looked for something a little bit more inside.

198
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,990
斯特林公司会仔细审查每个外包商
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sterling meticulously vets all private contractors.

199
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,920
审查过程长达数月  所以不可能突然
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The process takes a month, so the sudden addition

200
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,840
更换了两个维护人员
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}of two new maintenance workers didn't make sense,

201
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,810
而且还在24小时后又开除了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}especially since they were deleted less than 24 hours later.

202
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,960
-是他们的疏忽么  -并不是  我够幸运
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- They made a mistake? - No, I just got lucky.

203
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,770
文件被打乱并篡改
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The files were scrubbed and overwritten.

204
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,640
如果不是突然的电涌引发了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I would never have found them if not for a power surge

205
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,670
站外数据备份  我不可能找到他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that triggered an off-site data backup.

206
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,740
这是糖果·贝茨
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's Sugar Bates.

207
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,620
前获奖拳手  现在本地经营酒吧  有案底
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Ex-prizefighter, local bartender, and an ex-con.

208
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,910
-抢劫过  -故意伤人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Robbery? - Aggravated assault.

209
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,330
贝茨先生只会以力取胜  缺少计谋
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mr. Bates solves his problems with brute force, not skill.

210
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,210
-这是当晚的司机  -他是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He was the van driver. - Who's that?

211
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,050
这就是问题所在  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, that's the question, isn't it?

212
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,330
我交叉比对了所有面部识别数据库的数据
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I cross-referenced every facial recognition database there is--

213
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,480
包括国安局  中国国安部  以色列摩萨德
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}NSA, MSS, Mossad.

214
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,730
要么就是这货躲过了所有
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Either this guy is completely invisible

215
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,490
监控摄像头和间谍卫星的监视
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to all surveillance cameras and spy satellites,

216
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,550
要么就是他黑进了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or he's managed to exploit

217
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,090
世界上最先进的电脑安全网络
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}the most secure computer systems ever designed.

218
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,100
他是个黑客
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's a hacker.

219
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,150
不出意外的话  他是那位黑客
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If I'm right, he's the hacker.

220
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,780
网端狂热者的一员  中情局追踪多年无果
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}CIA's been chasing their tails for years trying to find this guy.

221
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,230
黑客们的偶像  人称贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The online fanboys, they call him Job.

222
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,710
但没人知道他的真实身份
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But nobody knows for sure who he really is.

223
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,660
你找到他了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You find him?

224
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,260
在过去的12小时
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Over the last 12 hours,

225
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,310
他的手机发出的微弱信号
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}there's been a flurry of cellular activity,

226
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,300
显示区号是215
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all originating from phones registered to the 215 area code.

227
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,400
费城
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Philadelphia.

228
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,910
信号发出地在城南
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Transmissions are localized to the towers to the south.

229
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,030
那儿有很多建筑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}There's a lot of buildings there,

230
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,930
但只有一座废弃的高中
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but only one abandoned high school.

231
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,400
-地址是  -广溪路57号
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Address? - 57 Broad Creek Road.

232
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,410
好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay.

233
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,750
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Listen, Job--

234
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,720
这是最后一次帮你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This was the last time.

235
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,040
瞧  你不是也不行了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, look who's finally winded.

236
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,150
我天  你中弹了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus Christ, you're hit.

237
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,940
快从我的博夫曼沙发上起来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Get the fuck off my Baughman chair.

238
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,870
你知不知道把你的血
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you know how hard it is

239
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,200
从雪呢绒上弄掉有多难
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to get blood out of chenille upholstery?

240
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,480
行行好  把嘴闭上好么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, do me a favor. Shut the fuck up, would you?

241
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,950
别动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Stay here.

242
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,360
没人知道这儿
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This place is completely off the grid.

243
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,760
如果道尔顿知道的话  他在给你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If Dalton knew about it, don't you think he would have told you

244
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,830
任务的时候  就告诉你了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}when he gave you your marching orders?

245
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,610
你在道尔顿手下多久了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How long you been under Dalton's thumb?

246
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,730
很久了  你怎么认识他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Too long. How do you know him?

247
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,720
我技术高超  但遇人不淑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I have a unique skill set. In a rare lapse in judgment,

248
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,630
给你前老板打工
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I rendered services to your former boss,

249
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,490
还觉得他是个人物
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}thinking he was the real deal.

250
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,140
他不是么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He wasn't?

251
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,090
他们从来不是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, they never are.

252
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,580
我现在服务罪犯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I stick to criminals now.

253
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,900
和他们一起至少不用太担心
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At least you know where you stand with a criminal.

254
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,890
那你怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So what's your story?

255
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,470
我来猜猜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let me guess.

256
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,580
道尔顿在你不顺的时候找上你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dalton got to you when you were at rock bottom.

257
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,070
和你说他能让你更有价值
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Told you he could make you something more.

258
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,990
这种人总有办法说服别人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Man does have a way of getting inside your head.

259
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,960
而且只对我们这些牛人有效
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Happens to the best of us.

260
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,070
你说你能帮我摆脱他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You said you could help me get away from him.

261
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,000
要怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}How?

262
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,570
他找不到  所以杀不了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He can't kill us if he can't find us.

263
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,040
-他会找到我的  -试试看咯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He can find me. - He can try.

264
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,390
他能通过卫星  数据库
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He got access to satellites, databases,

265
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,790
定制软件来定位一个人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and custom software that can locate almost anybody anywhere.

266
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,030
但你猜猜  那些东西是谁设计的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But who the fuck do you think designed that software?

267
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,120
等我完成了我该做的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}By the time I'm done doing my thing,

268
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
你就会变成无迹可寻的幽灵
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you are going to be a fucking ghost.

269
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,690
先从名字开始
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, let's start with your name.

270
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,730
我们是警察  放下武器  放下
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff's Department! Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

271
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,650
-给我放下  -放下你的枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Put 'em down! - Drop your gun.

272
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,510
-去你的  -布罗克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Fuck you. - Brock!

273
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,560
-艾米丽  你没事吧  -她很好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Emily, you all right? - She's fine.

274
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,240
-暂时的  -你敢碰她你死定了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- For now. - You touched her, you're a dead man.

275
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,080
一个快要被打成马蜂窝的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Those are tough words coming from a man

276
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,540
还敢口出狂言
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}who's about to get shot full of holes.

277
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,260
-彼此彼此  -都别开枪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah, right back at you. - Nobody's getting shot.

278
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,320
-胡德  -终于有个有脑子的了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Hood. - Now, there's a voice of reason.

279
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,700
-请问你是  -卢卡斯·胡德警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- And you are? - Sheriff Lucas Hood.

280
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,130
警长吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sheriff.

281
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,030
那好吧  胡德警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, then, Sheriff Hood,

282
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,310
你有什么解决办法吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}do you have a solution in mind?

283
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,280
我们只救这个女人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're only here for the woman.

284
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,760
那普罗科特先生呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And Mr. Proctor?

285
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,670
你跟他有什么过节
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Whatever's going on between you and him,

286
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,040
那是你的事  我不管
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}that's your business.

287
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,800
说的真好  我简直不敢相信
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now, that sounds too good to be true.

288
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,300
达成共识了吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do we have a deal?

289
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,650
放那个女孩走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let the girl go.

290
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,590
等等  你到底在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wait, what the hell are you talking about?

291
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,350
-你不能这样做  -艾米丽  我们走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You can't do that. - Emily, let's go.

292
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,400
-不  我不走  -艾米丽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- No, I'm not leaving. - Emily!

293
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,770
-他们会弄死他的  -要滚快滚
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- They're gonna kill him. - Get the fuck out!

294
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,520
我们走  艾米丽  走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go. Emily, come on.

295
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,540
快  我们走  快点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on. Let's go, come on.

296
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,910
很好  我们走吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's all right. Come on, let's go.

297
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,180
卧槽
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, shit.

298
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,610
-你跟踪我们  -我叔叔在哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What, did you follow us? - Where's my uncle?

299
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,590
走啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on.

300
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,990
什么  你竟然没救他出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wait, did you just leave him in there?

301
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,260
-我们走  -搞什么鬼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Let's go. - What the fuck?!

302
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,460
快走  跟我走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Come on. Let's go.

303
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,370
雷诺克斯说你推荐你侄女丽贝卡
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lennox tells me you're grooming your niece Rebecca

304
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,050
当你的接班人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}to be your successor.

305
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,420
我们要看看她能否胜任
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We'll have to see if she's up for the task.

306
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,550
我会为你的灵魂祈祷  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I will pray for your soul, Kai.

307
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,280
不过我觉得现在
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But I think at this point,

308
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,680
即使是上帝也不知道如何拯救你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}even God doesn't know what to make of you.

309
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,210
安息吧  老朋友
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Rest in peace, old friend.

310
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,460
把门锁上
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Lock the door.

311
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,830
非常乐意为您效劳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm gonna enjoy this.

312
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,450
我也是
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Me, too.

313
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,020
博登
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Burton!

314
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,140
杀了他
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Shoot him off.

315
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,530
叔叔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Uncle!

316
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,970
他们本想烧死我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They were going to burn me.

317
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,350
在我母亲去世后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}After my mother died...

318
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,660
我以为上帝是仁慈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought that I felt the grace of God.

319
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,100
他要召唤我回去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought he was calling me back.

320
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,120
可那不是上帝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That wasn't God.

321
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,190
只是因为悲痛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That was just grief.

322
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,680
和空虚感
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}An emptiness.

323
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,540
他们失脚的时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}To me belong vengeance and recompense.

324
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
{\an8}《圣经》《申命记》第32章

325
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,020
伸冤报应在我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Their foot shall slide in due time.

326
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,370
因他们遭灾的日子近了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The day of their calamity is at hand.

327
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,410
那要临在他们身上的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And the things that shall come upon them

328
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,410
必速速来到
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}make haste.

329
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,080
{\an8}对不起  母亲

330
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,510
等等
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey.

331
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,770
站住别动
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, stay where you are.

332
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,970
嗨  别跑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Stop.

333
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,320
我要和警长谈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I need to talk to the sheriff.

334
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,090
-你会跟他见面的  -你不明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Yeah, you can talk to him. - You don't understand.

335
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,500
-他认识我  -你叫什么名字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- He knows me. - What's your name?

336
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,570
蒂法·霍普韦尔
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Deva Hopewell.

337
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,840
-你是镇长的孩子  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You the mayor's kid? - Yes.

338
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,070
嗨  霍普韦尔小姐  别跑
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hey, hey, hey. Miss Hopewell. Hey, hey, stop.

339
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,620
霍普韦尔小姐  你被捕了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Miss Hopewell, you are under arrest.

340
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,190
你有权保持沉默
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You have the right to remain silent.

341
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,530
你所说或所做的一切
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Anything you say or do

342
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,310
都将成为呈堂证供
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}will be held against you in a court of law.

343
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,660
-这些事需要时间  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- These things take time. - Yeah.

344
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,150
我能应付的来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I can handle it.

345
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,030
-你可以吗  -大多数时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Can you? - Most of the time.

346
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,560
这他妈什么情况
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck is this?

347
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,070
贾斯帕  布莱斯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jasper, Bryce.

348
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,340
老天爷  邦克  你做条子了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus Christ, Bunker. You're a fucking pig?

349
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,790
我是女妖镇副警长
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm a Banshee deputy sheriff.

350
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,290

{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You're a motherfucking traitor.

351
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,790
我真该朝你心脏戳一刀
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should stab you through the heart.

352
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,110
表达你的观点不犯法
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Expressing your opinion isn't a crime,

353
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,050
但威胁警官就不行了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but threatening a peace officer is.

354
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,100
那在哈里斯堡欺负人也是违法的啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}So was torching that kike temple in Harrisburg,

355
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,770
但我记得你也照做不误了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I don't remember that stopping you.

356
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,610
-还是加尔文管事吗  -必须的啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Calvin still running things? - Damn straight he is.

357
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,310
但如果你觉得他会护着你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}But if you think he's gonna protect you from us,

358
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,930
那你就想多了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}you got another think coming.

359
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,300
加尔文应该在他有机会的时候就杀了你
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Calvin should have killed you when he had the chance.

360
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,690
你告诉我兄弟  我会很快见到他的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You tell my brother I'll be seeing him real soon.

361
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,750
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you, boys.

362
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,590
你是上校  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Why, Colonel, right?

363
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,760
你也当过兵吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Were you a military man?

364
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:25,890
不是  只是看过很多电影
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No, just watch a lot of movies.

365
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,260
想喝什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What's your poison?

366
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,520
美格纯正波本  不加冰
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maker's Mark, neat.

367
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,270
在女巫镇这么久了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}All this time in Banshee

368
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,600
我还从来没来过这里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I've never been in here before.

369
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,880
这里嘛
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, it's...

370
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,660
没什么讲究的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}not much to look at,

371
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:42,950
只是勉强能住而已
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but at least the roof doesn't leak.

372
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,940
嗯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Hmm.

373
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,400
有一天发生了件疯狂的事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You know, the craziest thing happened the other day.

374
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,920
-真的吗  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Did it? - Mmm.

375
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,690
四个傻逼决定
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Four idiots decided to steal

376
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,950
从我那儿偷钱  一大笔钱
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}a considerable amount of my money.

377
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,350
还有这事
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Is that so?

378
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,420
但这还不是最疯狂的呢
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Mm, but that's not the crazy part.

379
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,990
这些人还觉得能逃之夭夭
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}These guys actually thought they were gonna get away with it.

380
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,420
你这样是两败俱伤啊
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}See, what you have here is a lose-lose situation.

381
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,230
我从来不会输
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I never lose.

382
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,740
妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Damn it!

383
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,510
谢谢你的酒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thanks for the drink.

384
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,220
操你妈
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck you.

385
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,290
贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Job.

386
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,010
你他妈是谁
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Who the fuck are you?

387
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,650
我叫利奥  也许你听说过我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}My name is Leo. Maybe you've heard of me.

388
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,230
别装逼
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't flatter yourself.

389
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,440
我听说过你  贾伯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Well, I've definitely heard of you, Job.

390
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,220
所以我用了两倍的镇静剂
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}That's why I doubled the sedative.

391
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,040
此时此刻对我来说很重要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}This is actually a very big moment for me.

392
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,860
-你要回去救他  -不  小艾  我不去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- You have to go back for him. - No, Em, I don't.

393
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,800
-别闹了  -那我去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Now come on. - Well, then I will.

394
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,500
听我说  小艾
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}The hell you are. Em, listen to me. Listen.

395
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,770
你知道你今晚离死亡有多近吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you have any idea how close you came to dying tonight?

396
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,450
他们会因为他杀了你的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}They were going to kill you because of him.

397
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,620
-放开我  -天哪
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Let go of me! - Jesus Christ!

398
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,310
醒醒
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Open your eyes!

399
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,810
你明白吗  你他妈的和一个变态搞在了一起
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you understand? You are shacking up with a fucking psychopath.

400
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:48,990
所以你因为嫉妒要让他死吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What, you're going to let him die because you're jealous?

401
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,530
去你妈的  布罗克  你个懦夫
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck you, Brock! You coward.

402
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,220
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, yeah?

403
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,490
我操
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Oh, fuck!

404
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,790
不用谢我他妈救你一命
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}And you're welcome for saving your goddamn life.

405
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,350
先生
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sir.

406
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,200
她在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where is she?

407
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,570
需要您在这份报告上签字
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I just need your signature on this report

408
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,030
就可以带您女儿回家了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and you can take your daughter home.

409
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,070
-她不回家  -什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- She's not going home. - What?

410
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,330
至少今晚不行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}At least not tonight.

411
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,120
好的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Yes, sir.

412
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,990
抱歉  蒂法  我不知道还能怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I'm sorry, Deva. I don't know what else to do.

413
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,780
爸爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dad.

414
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,270
爸爸
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Dad!

415
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,200
谢天谢地
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank God.

416
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,350
我还以为你死了  快过来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I thought you were dead. Come on.

417
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,530
好吧  得送你去医院
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Okay, we're gonna have to get you to the hospital.

418
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,390
绝对不能去医院
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}We're not going to any hospital.

419
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,670
-为什么  -我犯错了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- Why? - I made a mistake.

420
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,150
我不应该让事情到了这个地步
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I should never have allowed things to go this far.

421
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,760
你在说什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What are you talking about?

422
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,290
我们不能再见面了
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You and I will never see each other again.

423
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:39,940
我不明白
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I-- I don't understand.

424
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,090
谢谢你对我母亲那么好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Thank you for your services to my mother.

425
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,510
我会好好补偿你的辛劳
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You'll be compensated for your time and trouble.

426
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,790
别这样  凯
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Wait, don't do this, Kai.

427
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,910
我知道你是想保护我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know you're trying to protect me,

428
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,560
但只要跟你在一起  我就不怕他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but I'm not afraid of those men when I'm with you.

429
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,370
再见
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Good-bye.

430
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,170
你该怕的不是他们
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's not those men you need to be afraid of.

431
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,130
我知道你也许很难相信
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I know this might be hard to believe,

432
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,000
但是你父亲觉得这样才是为你好
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}but your father thinks he's doing what's best for you.

433
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,700
他不是我父亲
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}He's not really my father.

434
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,560
邦克
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Bunker.

435
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,590
长官  霍普韦尔小姐必须留下来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sir, Miss Hopewell is being held for possession.

436
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,630
把钥匙给我
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me the keys.

437
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,030
快走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Let's go.

438
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,830
我很尊敬你  长官
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}With all due respect, sir,

439
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,050
但是霍普韦尔镇长希望她留下来过夜
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}mayor Hopewell wanted her to stay overnight.

440
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,580
我不在乎他想干什么  快走
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I don't give a shit what he wants. Let's go.

441
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,380
有东西吗  我带你回去
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}You got any stuff? I'll take you home.

442
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,430
抱歉吵醒了你  我没忍住
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Sorry to wake you. I just couldn't help myself.

443
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,170
我得承认  我可能是你的头号粉丝
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I must admit, I am probably your biggest fan.

444
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,710
你他妈要是想要我的签名
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}If you wanted my autograph, motherfucker,

445
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,920
张个嘴就行
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}all you had to do was ask.

446
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,830
再说吧
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Maybe later.

447
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,450
别浪费力气  回头用得着
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Save your strength. You're going to need it.

448
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,200
事情的展开真是奇妙
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}It's funny how things work out.

449
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,850
你不觉得吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Don't you think?

450
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,570
不过我很好奇
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}I am curious, though.

451
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,390
你决定偷我的钱  是什么时候
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Was the decision to steal my money made before or--

452
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,950
跟我上床之前还是之后
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}or after you spread your legs for me?

453
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,380
你真觉得我会自愿跟你睡吗
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Do you really think I'd fuck you if I didn't have to?

454
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,040
把你的同伙供出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me the name of your fourth,

455
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,370
我就让你少受点苦
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}and I'll keep your suffering to a minimum.

456
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,240
不要
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}No.

457
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,030
把名字说出来
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Give me a fucking name now.

458
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,800
去你妈的
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Fuck you.

459
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,900
不管怎样  我会找到你在保护的人
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}One way or another, I will find the person you're protecting.

460
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,470
问题在于
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Only question is, how much

461
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,770
等我找到的时候  你会变成几块
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}of you is going to be left by the time I do?

462
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,420
搞什么  胡德  你没权利带蒂法回家
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}What the fuck, Hood? You had no right taking Deva home.

463
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,690
你听我说  你他妈离我女儿远点
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Now you listen to me. You stay the hell away from my daughter.

464
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,010
5.56口径北约绿尖子弹
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}5.56 NATO Green Tip.

465
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,530
安娜在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Where's Ana?

466
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,560
-什么  -你妻子在哪里
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}- What? - Where is your wife?

467
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,660
操他妈的  你又做了什么
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14}Jesus Christ, what the fuck did you do now?
